explanation     difference       number   mpsigfp mrnas produced     cytomegalovirus immediateearly promoter may have exceeded   number   viral genomes   gag normally encounters   an infected cell nevertheless packaging   mpsigfp mrna   wt   super m gag was apparently specific because incorporation     mpsi control was only 15   110   efficient   result reveals   although   absolute amounts
