 an intact pppy motif   phenotype     psap mutation was less pronounced than       pppy mutation since virus release was reduced   only   factor   two when psap was changed   release defect was much

seems likely   whether       ptsap motif can function   an l domain depends     context     gag protein   em results obtained     study suggest     defects     pppy     psap variants   mpmv   both
