  significantly weaker   yeast than   mammalian cells because   gat domain   yeast gga1p     targeted     golgi however   gat domain does contribute   golgi localization vhsgat   golgi localized whereas vhs alone   vhsgatl203q   cytosolic   strength     interactions between ggas   other proteins via   vhs   hingeear domains could stabilize   gga arf interaction     golgi   allow signaling   activated arf   favor   model     interaction between gga   arf   stabilized   other protein interactions hence reducing   effect     mutations   vivo   conclude     role   arf gga interaction   yeast       recruit ggas     golgi   rather   alter   structure   ggas   allow sequential interactions   clathrin   other components unfortunately   cannot detect expression   mammalian ggas   yeast   have tried multiple promoters fusion constructs   truncation constructs only   twohybrid constructs   expressed     detectable level furthermore   cannot detect yeast ggas   mammalian cells after either plasmid transfection   protein microinjection hence   cannot test   complementation     yeast phenotypes   wildtype   mutant human ggas  differences between gga1p   gga2p  previous reports concluded   gga1p   gga2p   functionally redundant because expression   either gga1p   gga2p can complement   defects   gga1gga2 strains  however   data reveal differences between gga1p   gga2p three mutant alleles   gga2p function fully     traffickingrelated assays whereas   function   mutant gga1p   reduced also full complementation   gga1gga2 defects   gga1p requires high expression levels     several possible explanations   these differences first gga1p   gga2p may perform distinct functions   yeast   only gga1p function   dependent upon interaction   arf   scenario   unlikely because   gga1gga2 defects described   date can   rescued   expression   either gga1p   gga2p second   different effect     mutations may reflect differences   affinities   arf   feel       best explanation     data   twohybrid   affinity chromatography analyses indicate     interaction between gga1p   arfs   weaker than   between gga2p   arfs whether these differences   affinity     true reflection   affinity   vivo     known     mutations reduce affinity   arf   reduction could ablate gga1p arf interaction   vivo     fully ablate gga2p arf interaction perhaps   would see an effect     gga2p

gga1p could force interaction   these proteins thus complementing   double deletion fifth   level   expression   gga2p may   higher than     gga1p   noted previously  however   results   hatagged gga1p   gga2p argue     expression levels     fact very similar finally   l203q mutation may reduce interaction   another unknown partner   gga proteins     involved   gga function although   cannot rule out   possibility   current evidence strongly favors gga arf interaction via   gat domain  roles   vhs domain    vhs domain   required   function   construct lacking   vhs domain fails   rescue   ts phenotype   gga1gga2vps27   conclusion   consistent   two recent reports  showing     vhs domain   required   cpy sorting     yeast   mammalian vhs domains   gga proteins have similar functions

gga vhs domain      also   interesting   identify essential residues within   gga vhs domain required   function   also show     vhs domain contributes     golgi localization   gga proteins likely through interaction   other golgiassociated proteins   contribution   seen most definitively     vhsgat construct   gfpgga1p   construct gfpgga1p1 331   localized   golgilike puncta whereas addition     l203q mutation causes exclusively cytosolic staining     possible     l203q mutation alters folding     vhsgat construct such   interactions     vhs domain   disrupted       favor   explanation because   l203q mutation has only minor effects   gga1p function   l203q altered vhs folding   would expect   total loss   function phenotype     vhs deletion hence   conclude   both   vhs domain     gat domain interact weakly   golgilocalized proteins     together these interactions confer golgi localization   seems     gfpgga1p construct lacking   vhs domain localizes     puncta than does fulllength gfpgga1p     two possibilities     staining pattern first   construct may fragment   late golgi second   truncated gga1p may mislocalize   other membranes such   early golgi   endosomes   data using vps27delta cells show     class e compartment forms     construct still localizes   distinct puncta supporting   second possibility these data suggest     vhs domain confers specificity     late golgi perhaps   binding   cargo proteins     present     tgn because   vhsgat construct localizes   golgi   gat alone does     genetic screen   mutants   disrupt golgi localization   vhsgat may
