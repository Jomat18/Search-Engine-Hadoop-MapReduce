identification   binding sites     factors involved   such regulation   number   computer algorithms have been proposed     discovery   novel regulatory elements   nucleotide sequences most   these try   deduce   regulatory elements   considering   regulatory regions   several putatively coregulated genes     single genome such algorithms search   overrepresented motifs     collection   regulatory regions these motifs being   candidates   regulatory elements examples     approach include          adopt an orthogonal approach   deducing regulatory elements   considering orthologous regulatory regions     single gene   several species   approach   called phylogenetic footprinting    simple premise underlying phylogenetic footprinting     selective pressure causes functional elements   evolve     slower rate than     nonfunctional sequences   means   unusually well conserved sites among   set   orthologous regulatory regions   excellent candidates   functional regulatory

human   mouse has recently become popular    major advantage   phylogenetic footprinting over   single genome multigene approach mentioned earlier       latter requires   reliable method   assembling

has been used   phylogenetic footprinting     construct   global multiple alignment     orthologous regulatory sequences       identify conserved regions     alignment   tool such   clustalw    appropriate     purpose     can take advantage   knowledge     phylogeny relating   species   see why   approach   phylogenetic footprinting does   always work consider typical lengths     sequences involved regulatory elements tend     quite short 5   20 nucleotides long relative     entire regulatory region       search   them   1000bp promoter region would   typical given these relative lengths     species   somewhat diverged     likely     noise     diverged nonfunctional background   overcome   short conserved signal   result       alignment may   align   short regulatory elements together     case   regulatory elements would   appear   belong   conserved regions   would go undetected thus when   entire regulatory regions considered   moderately   highly diverged global multiple alignment   likely   miss significant signals  made similar observations   conjunction   their comparative analysis   several saccharomyces species   discovered       species   too closely related   sequence alignment   obvious   uninformative because   functional elements     sufficiently better conserved than   surrounding nonfunctional sequence     other hand     species   too distantly related     difficult   impossible   find an accurate alignment   discussion   these issues see  rather than relying   multiple alignment     successful recent approach   phylogenetic

general motif discovery algorithms were designed     different purpose however   have their own drawback none take into account   phylogenetic relationship     given sequences     these methods assume   input sequences     independent   can   problematic   example   data sets containing   mixture   some closely related species   some distant ones     phylogeny underlying   data   ignored similar sequences     set   closely related species   have an unduly high weight     choice   motifs reported even   these methods were modified   weight   input sequences unequally   would still   capture

also many known binding sites   were   found     approach     illuminating   analyze why footprinter did   detect those motifs   course     end   reason must     these motifs were   sufficiently well conserved     reported       detailed study   instructive   known binding sites missed   footprinter can   divided into five categories first some binding sites appear   have   significant matches   most other species   example   thyroid hormone receptor t3r binding site upstream     rat growth hormone 1     pur1 binding site upstream     rat insulin gene   both conserved only   rodents     very little hope   detecting these sites   phylogenetic footprinting unless   large number   closely related species     case rodents   available second some binding sites show very   conservation   only over   region     shorter than   ones   looked         case     gcbox   metallothionein   sequence ggggcgg       perfectly conserved     four mtii sequences   has only one mutation     mtiii sequences   substring gggg   actually conserved   almost   mammalian isoforms   may have been able   detect these kinds   motifs had   searched   motifs     length   did search   motifs   length 7     gcbox was   reported because   did   span   large enough part     tree however such short motifs   often likely   occur simply   chance   nonfunctional sequences   could have allowed such short motifs     results would have been   likely   contain false positives third   small number   binding sites appear     relatively well conserved   have had insertions   deletions although       clear     sequences   insertions   deletions   still functional footprinter can allow   insertions   deletions     motifs found     chose     use   option       believed   insertions   deletions   rare   binding sites allowing   insertions   deletions would thus have produced   few   true positives   most likely     price   many   false positives fourth some motifs   quite well conserved     barely fail   meet   statistical significance thresholds       case     creb binding sites   ct  regulatory element   insulin both     have parsimony score 3 over   motif   length 8 again allowing     many mutations would have produced   number   false positives however   sequences     organisms had been available these two motifs might have been detected without increasing   false positive rate fifth some transcription factors bind   dimers     case   binding site may consist   two conserved regions separated     few variable nucleotides   example   metallothionein mtii transcription factors     ap2 dimer family   known   bind   ble element visual inspection reveals     pattern tgacnnnnngcgg where n     variable nucleotide   perfectly conserved     four mtii genes because     variable

leaving out spurious hits   briefly discuss some   them here first notice       formulation     phylogenetic footprinting problem   position       motif   found   each sequence   ignored       typical feature   local alignment methods       approach belongs however   some circumstances     desirable   penalize motifs   positions     set   homologous sequences   vary too much     thus unlikely     instances     single conserved binding site       natural way   incorporate   notion   position into   parsimony score   simply augment   definition   motif   until   was just   kmer     number   indicates   approximate position     kmer     sequence     study   usually divided each input sequence into 10 equalsized regions   assigned   cost   one mutation     motif   move   an adjacent region   fact   avoid inaccuracies when   motif occurs near   region boundary   view each motif   also occurring     two adjacent regions   approach   dividing   sequences into regions only makes sense     believe   corresponding regions   each input sequence   approximately homologous   upstream sequences   may     reasonable assumption however   introns   did   use   option     variation   intron size makes   unclear   portions   homologous     original definition     phylogenetic footprinting problem allowing   regulatory element losses       cost associated   losing   regulatory element except     motif spans   smaller part     tree   sometimes leads   undesirable situations     footprinter finds   motif   seems well conserved   two very distantly related species x   y thus spanning   large part     tree     appears   have been lost independently     phyla branching between x   y these multiple independent losses   quite unlikely   evolution   one would like   penalize motifs   have been lost along too many branches once again   fits very nicely into   parsimony framework         assigning   cost   losing   motif along   given branch     results reported     paper   equate   cost   one substitution however one could also assign different loss costs along different branches     losses along long branches cost less than those along short branches     case   gene families one may want   assign   smaller cost   motifs lost   branches   follow duplication events   regulatory elements may   likely     lost   these times finally     often useful   restrict   number   mutations along any given branch     phylogenetic tree   example   cases       motif   very well conserved   some subset     sequences   avoids finding spurious poorly conserved instances     motif   sequences   actually     contain   true binding site limiting   number   mutations per branch also has   very positive effect     running time     algorithm  statistical significance  any set   sequences contains some best conserved motif     does   mean     motif was actually under selective pressure   make sure     motifs reported have   mutation rate significantly less than       surrounding nonfunctional sequence   generated   set   random sequences   approximately   same evolutionary history     input sequences   set   sequences was generated   simulating evolution over   given phylogenetic tree     inferred branch lengths these simulated sequences thus mimic   real input sequences except     mutation rate     same     sites   thus   should   find any unusually well
