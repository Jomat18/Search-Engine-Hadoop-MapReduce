***This is Project Gutenberg's 29th Fourth of July on the Internet!***
**Help us celebrate by keeping us alive as a continuing institution!**

We have about 50 Etext releases for you in this Newsletter!

With so many entering the Etext field this year, we are one endangered
species I don't think the world can do as well without. . .everyone is
saying they can put a million Etexts online, but none of them actually
have DONE even a thousand. . .they mostly just copy from others. . .as
much as I *LIKE* having our files copied around the world. . .I do NOT
want that to be our undoing. . .if you can help, please read below!!!!

There are nearly 50 new Etexts listed below, all but one produced by a
volunteer corps at Project Gutenberg; you won't find that kind of text
production anywhere else, and we are now in our 29th year of doing it.

*

But First. . .Current Requests for Assistance From Our Volunteers:

1.  We still need PERL writers, and I lost my list of them in the crash.

2.  The 1999 CIA World Factbook should be completed just about now;
if any of you can send me a copy, it would be greatly appreciated.

3.  We may still need more proofers for Anna Karenina; will those
currently working on it please contact me.

4.  We have a copy of Martin Luther's publication of the Bible,
in German fractur. . .and will need some serious help on it. . . .
I would LIKE to think there is already an Etext of it available,
if anyone can help us find it.

5.  From:   "Whiting, Jenifer" <jenifer.whiting@PTSEM.EDU>
A request for the text "The Flying Inn" by G.K. Chesterton
Most likely found in older editions in UK and Australia,
but any edition that credits its content as originally
from before 1923 will do just fine.  Her copy was stolen,
along with lots of other things, in a car break in. . .mh
[I think we have a copy coming, but this was not confirmed]


6.  I am working on a 4 volume collection of Samuel Adams' writings
(H. A. Cushing, ed., 1904). The collection covers the years 1764-1802.

I would like to thank Richard Fane and Daniel Moore for all their work
getting  volume III done, and half of volume IV.  We can still use several
scanners and especially proofreaders in order to be able to do volumes I
and II.

Even a few pages of proofreading would be helpful.

If you can help, please email me:
Regina Azucena <razucena@netway.com>


7.  The Human Genome Project:  we are going to need volunteers
to help us with this, unless we can find a way to FTP those 24
chromosomes directly into our /etext00 directories. . .*these*
files are large. . .more details below.

[Different Numbering System for Requests than other items]


8. Found an etext of The Golden Bowl by Henry James,
http://www.newpaltz.edu/~hathaway/goldenbowl1.html
If anyone can find a pre-1923 matching paper edition,
then we can post it.


*

1.  More Languages [Japanese, Chinese, Swedish, Danish, DNA. . .more.]

1.  We would LOVE to post one file in a language we have not worked
with before in each of the remaining months of 1999, and perhaps in
2000, if we can.  No matter what format, we are willing to post it,
but would also like to post in the simplest possible format as well
. . .when this is possible.  We may still need help with posting
our Swedish and Danish Bibles. . .just to make sure we haven't
mangled the files.


2.  The Human Genome Project [11% complete at 375 Megabytes]

2.  If you would like to join our Human Genome Project Team,
please email Eliana Brown at one of the following, and cc:me
Eliana Brown <eliana_b68@yahoo.com><brown12@students.uiuc.edu>
We need help getting them to prairienet.org, and perhaps with
putting the headers on them. . .the files are large. . .and we
don't have an easy internal way to get them there. . .thanks!


We have successfully downloaded our first chromosomes, and the
smallest one we could, the Y chromosome, is 3.5 Megabytes.  We
have reserved 26 slots for June, 2000, for the 24 files and a
few instructions and commentaries on how to read and use them.
This will eventually total some 3.38 Gigabytes, so we could use
some programming help to create a compression program that would
take only 2 bits to store any of the GATC amino acids, and would
unpack them for our readers. . .otherwise this one item will at
least quadruple the size of Project Gutenberg.  Zip is currently
compressing at 70%, I have not tried the higher compression zip
options yet. . . .  However, even if we represented each character
with two bits, it would be hard to get much beyond 75%, unless we
used a particularly good algorithm.  We tried one combination of
our own plus zip and got 77%. . .not sure if worth the hassle.


3.  We need help getting incorporated as a 501 (C) 3, need a lawyer.
    [We had a volunteer lawyer, but lost email contact]

This would probably be done in Illinois, and it is obvious we need
to do this, or we won't get the donations required to do more than
our original goal of 10,000 books. . .we are currently doing Etext
at a rate that will reach 3,333 by the end of 2001. . .not bad for
an unincorporated bunch of volunteers whose Executive Director has
not had any paychecks for 6 months and probably won't for the next
6 months, and went through this same situation only two years ago.


4.  We need help getting major grants. . .grant writers needed!

We will get our 10,000 Etexts done, whether we receive any funding
of a major nature or not, but we could do 1,000,000 Etexts in just
20 more years, if we could get some 10 million dollar grants.  The
truth is that if we are going to spend time on other than Etext, I
would prefer that we go all out in this direction.


5.  We need help with Public Relations. . .I lost the address
of our new PR person in the big crash, please email me again!
We have an excellent opportunity to be the cover story on the
Sunday Supplement of a very major newspaper, very shortly.  We
did the preliminary interview last weekend, and we should also
prepare a press release for our 2,000th Etext, Human Genome,
and our new language efforts.  Which reminds me, we may still
need help with Swedish and Danish.

6.  You may want to try our new site at:  www.instinct.org/gutenberg/

7.  From Daniel Meyers:  Here's what I'm ready to offer.
The most up-to-date possible, full texts from Project
Gutenberg on a two CD set for $39.95 (+$5.00 S/H).
Interested parties should send e-mail to
gutenberg@monogames.com and they will be notified
when and where they can order on-line.

Project Gutenberg will receive $34.95 of the above amount.
Major credit cards and checks will be accepted.

8.  We have a new German/Fraktur Team. . .and we need volunteers.
Mike Pullen <globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com>  German and Fraktur Team

9.  We still need help finished up Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
Please contact me if you can find any edition from before 1923.

TO TURN ELECTRONIC PAPER INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
Though emphasizing "it won't be on the market in the next year," an
executive of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center says that Xerox and 3M have
signed a manufacturing agreement intended to turn electronic paper into a
commercial product, to be used in such applications as electronic
newspapers capable of adding late-breaking news as you read them.  Like a
computer screen but not much thicker than ordinary paper and almost as
flexible, electronic paper uses "gyricon" display technology developed at
Xerox PARC about ten years ago.  You'll (eventually) be able to write on it
with a wand or stylus or to put it through a computer printer.

 "PC AS SIMPLE AS A TOASTER" - THE $199 iToaster
A personal computer called the iToaster (because its developers say it's as
simple to operate as a toaster) will use the BeOS operating system, rather
than Microsoft's Windows.  Priced at $199 (without a monitor) and
manufactured by Microworkz.com in Seattle, the iToaster will offer word
processing, home finance, and Web browsing software, and will have a
graphical interface.  The company is reportedly in talks with America
Online about potential cross-marketing arrangements.  (MSNBC 21 Jun 99,

THE FIGHT OVER INTERNET DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION
Those who want to see the business of domain name registration opened up to
competition will have to wait at least three weeks longer, as tensions
build among the three major players in the discussion.  Those players are:
first, the Clinton Administration; second, Icann (Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers), the organization the Administration created to
assume responsibility for Internet administration;  and, third, Network
Solutions Inc. (NSI), the private company which since 1993 has had  the
exclusive worldwide right to assign all Internet addresses ending  with the
suffixes .com, .net, or .org.  NSI is refusing to sign the contract Icann
has developed, saying it gives more Icann more power than the
Administration had intended;  in particular, NSI is claiming sole ownership
to the rights of its database of more than 5 million registered domain
names.  Commerce Department staffer Becky Burr is optimistic that the
dispute will be resolved soon: "I believe it is in everybody's best
interest not to swing threats around."  In the meantime, Icann interim
president Mike Roberts notes, "It's great political theater."  (New York
Times 28 Jun 99)

IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF INFO TECH PROFESSIONALS?
A survey conducted on the Web site of Computer magazine to determine
attitudes about the shortage of information technology professionals found
that 54% of the 84 respondents believe that such a shortage indeed exists
and that liberal immigration policies are generally a good idea;  36% deny
that there's a shortage, and are convinced that corporate America is simply
claiming one so that it can import less expensive workers instead of
investing in the U.S. workforce.  The rest of the respondents say that the
global economy has created a new and complex problem which requires new
kinds of solutions.  (Computer May/Jun 99)

"WHO WANTS TO KNOW?"  (CUSTOMIZED HISTORY FROM ENCARTA)
Today's Wall Street Journal reports that the nine different editions of
Microsoft's Encarta multimedia encyclopedia sometimes give different
answers to the same question.  For example, the U.S., U.K, and German
editions say the inventor of the telephone was Alexander Graham Bell,
whereas the Italian version says the inventor was the impoverished
Italian-American candle maker Antonio Meucci.  Other editions vary on who
invented the electric light bulb, who discovered the virus that causes
AIDS, and other such things.  Microsoft says its editorial teams are made
up of local experts, and company chief executive Bill Gates argued in 1997:
 "In the long run, exposing people to worldwide perspectives should be
healthy.  Americans benefit from a better understanding of the Asian or
European view of important cultural and scientific events, and vice versa."

TRACKING ANONYMOUS SPAM
If you hate getting all those "Make Money Fast At Home!!!" messages from
people who use hard-to-trace or false return addresses, you might want to
use the services of www.spamcop.net, a Web site that allows you to take
action against unsolicited junk e-mail messages sent out in bulk
quantities.  Spam Cop is able to dissect the header information on such
messages, identify where they've come from, and send a message of complaint
to the network administer of the Internet service provider the spammer is
using.  (New York Times Circuits Section 24 Jun 99)

THREE WEEK DELAY IN OPENING UP INTERNET NAME REGISTRATION
The process to open the registration of Internet domain names to
competition has been delayed three weeks due to continued
tensions between the Clinton administration, monopoly-holder
Network Solutions, and would-be overseer ICANN.  Many have
accused ICANN of abusing its power, particularly by holding
closed meetings and by assigning a $1 annual fee to every domain
name registered.  Many were also angered by ICANN's threat to
terminate Network Solutions' authority to register new Internet
addresses, although ICANN has since admitted that only the
Commerce Department holds that authority.  Government officials
such as Virginia's Representative Thomas J. Bliley and Governor
James Gilmore, as well as lobbyists on behalf of Network
Solutions, have demanded investigations into the process of
choosing board members and ICANN's authority to charge the $1
fee.  Other major issues to be resolved include the question of
ownership regarding Network Solutions' user database, the terms
of ICANN's authority, and the prices that businesses must pay
Network Systems to administer the central registry.

TEXTBOOK PUBLISHER LAYS PLANS FOR AN INTERNET UNIVERSITY
Academic publishing house Harcourt General is joining the growing
business of distance education.  It plans to expand its online
offerings with three ventures:  Harcourt University; an Internet
high school for students planning to take high-school equivalency
exams; and an e-commerce site called Harcourt.com.  Through its
university, Harcourt may become the first major publishing house
to offer accredited college degrees, pending approval from the
New England Association of Schools and Colleges.  Yet Harcourt
faces much opposition, particularly from college professors
concerned that Internet-based education denies students the
personal interaction central to a traditional learning
experience.  University bookstores and other traditional
distributors may also oppose the venture because it competes with
their sales.  Last, Harcourt will face strong competition from
the companies and universities already providing online courses.
Harcourt maintains that its educational offerings will be unique.
Its university, which may begin to offer courses by September
2000, will teach a range of subjects in arts and sciences.

U.S. EASES RESTRICTIONS ON SELLING FAST PCS TO RUSSIA AND CHINA
President Clinton significantly reduced restrictions on exports
of powerful computers, arguing that technological innovations
have made laptop and desktop PCs as powerful as the
supercomputers produced just a few years ago.  Previously,
companies were required to obtain individual export licenses to
ship computers faster than 10,000 Mtops (Millions of theoretical
operations per second) to a group of countries which include most
of South America, South Korea, South Africa, and much of Southeast
Asia, but Clinton's order increased the limit to 20,000 Mtops.
The old laws also required companies shipping to a category of
countries deemed "proliferation risks" -- such as China and
Russia -- to obtain licenses to ship any computer faster than
2,000 Mtops to military users or 7,000 Mtops for civilian users.
In contrast, Intel's Pentium III chip is rated at about 1,300
Mtops, and versions due out later this year will hit about 2,000
Mtops.  (New York Times 07/02/99)


Y2K SCARE LEADS TO LARGER ADVANCES [_I_ think this is just to
counter the fact that most people will NOT buy computers now,
and for the next 6 months, until the bug date has passed. . .
which will mean HUGE losses for the economy. . . .  mh]

Experts say the Y2K bug may actually benefit companies and the
economy in general, as it forced many firms to completely
overhaul their computer systems and re-engineer their business
processes to become more efficient.  Federal Reserve Governor
Alan Greenspan noted in his June 1 congressional testimony that
the American economy "is displaying a remarkable run of economic
growth that appears to have its roots in ongoing advances in
technology," and many experts say the Y2K bug is to blame.  The
millennium bug gave senior management an urgent deadline for
assessing their computer systems as well as their entire business
processes, resulting in "a dramatic surge in buying" of ERP
systems, which reorganize and integrate a firm's accounting and
other business practices.  Thus many companies' antiquated
business operations have been modernized, merged, and streamlined
to prepare for Y2K, producing benefits such as increased
productivity, improved customer responsiveness, reduced
inventory, and increased efficiency.

U.S. TO MARKET INFO-TECH WORK TO TEENS  [This seesm to be more
PR aimed at "growing the economy" at the expense of the workers.
I know lots of people in this field, and I'm not sure ANY of the
people I hang out with on a daily basis are actually making the
$68,000 "average" salary mentioned in an earlier one of these.
However, it doesn't take too many Bill Gates to up the "average"
beyond any useful meaning. . .perhaps "median" would be better.]

The Department of Commerce next year is planning to launch a
major advertising campaign to convince teenagers to choose a
career in information technology.  The marketing campaign is
intended to help ease the shortage of high-tech workers by
convincing teenagers that computers are "cool" and  to dispel the
"negative 'geek' or 'nerd' stereotype of technical workers,"
according to Commerce Secretary William Daley.  Analysts estimate
that the U.S. tech industry will need more than 1.3 million tech
workers between 1996 and 2000, with California, Texas, and
Virginia being areas that will need workers the most. Among the
steps the Department advises to ease the shortage are forging
closer links between schools and tech companies, improving
methods of teaching math and science in high schools, and
increasing pay for teachers in those fields, and giving tech
workers incentives to fill teaching positions and train older
workers.  (Washington Post 07/01/99)

and. . .for those who have read this far, some of our support
notes that came in since I lost them in the big crash.

But are there really the texts of entire books?
Is it possible?  If yes, it must have been hard work - my admiration!

Keep up your great work.  :)

This is truly one of the greatest things on the net.  I go there all the
time to download and read my favorites.  Thank you so much and yes,
I am one of your fans.

PG has been one of, if not THE, the greatest aids to 'legitimizing'
electronic book publishing of new works.  Without your work to make
classic literature available in electronic format, we'd have a LOT
more difficulty with "But that's not a REAL book" than we do.

You have a LOT of fans here.  PG is one of the greatest things
on the net since the inception of the net.  We can all
only hope to make a large a contribution as you have.

I wish to thank all who have been, or are working on Project Gutenberg
for compiling so many interesting books.  They enable me, a student with
limited financial means to read books that cannot be obtained otherwise.

This is a GREAT! project! I only regret that I just discovered it.
[All the more reason we need to work on getting better PR--HELP!]

I can only thank everyone who've put in the hard work to make
those books available on PG.  In fact, I've read so many. . . .

Most recent read I did was last month, of the Gutenberg version
of "The Insidious Dr Fu Manchu", a fiction novel.

Thanks gang, for all the excellent and invaluable work!

I have read several classics from cover to cover on my trusty
Sharp laptop in the past year. Including PG's Pride and
Prejudice and Villette (I think that was PG)

What Michael Hart and other public domain people are doing is a
work of unprecedented philanthropy: a direct acceleration of
the democratisation of knowledge. They are to be applauded.

All the best, and thanks for all the wonderful
work you have been doing on the project. . . .

As always, please add my thanks to the list...

Michael
