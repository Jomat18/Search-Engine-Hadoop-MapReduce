                           -=] INTRODUCTION [=-

GUTINDEX.04 is a plain text listing of eBooks posted to the Project
Gutenberg collection between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004
with eBook numbers starting at 4801.

It is _not_ a database, but it is useful for identifying eBooks so that
they can be downloaded by means other than directly from the website,
such as ftp or wget.

For a detailed explanation of Project Gutenberg files and filenaming
procedures, refer to the file GUTINDEX.ALL.

           .:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.            

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is via our search page at

	http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/search

which allows searching by title, author, eBook number, language
and other bibliographic data.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.

To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest to you,
visit:

    http://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL

To directly access the file directories:

    http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/
        - or -
    ftp://www.gutenberg.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/

. . .then navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the
appropriate level, and then select the file you wish to download, using
your normal download procedures.  Example:

    eBook number 11 would be found in /1/11/11.txt
             1100              in /1/1/0/1100/1100.txt
    etc.

(Note that the subdirectory level number is one less than the full eBook
number; i.e., 1100.txt is _not_ in /1/1/0/0/1100/.)

   distribute legislation and rulings, but in this case it seemed
   worthwhile.  At 195 pages, the ruling is an extensive and informed
