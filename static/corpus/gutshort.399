This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for, Wednesday, March 3, 1999
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy


We need lots of help this month. . .please see below, if willing. . .!

Below that. . .we also have another month's worth of Etexts for you!!!

Contents:

0.  Just found out today, we are going to NEED some moderate funds,
    now, not just what I had hoped for the future! . . .more later.
1.  We Need Serious Help With Other Languages, More Than I Can Say.
2.  Project Gutenberg Etexts Now Available Via FTPMail. . . .
3.  Requests for Rafael Sabatini
The Sea-Hawk,  Captain Blood, or Banner of the Bull, pre-1923 books.
4  New This Month. . .besides the month's Etexts, more Shakespeare of
the apocryphal nature, a new edition Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.


It looks like we are going to need some VERY serious people to help on
doing Etexts in other languages. . .I am not willing to give up on the
other languages. . .but I now realize just how important it is to have
someone who can help coordinate the efforts in other languages. . . .


A.  Don Quixote in Spanish

We are apparently going to need ALL THE HELP WE CAN POSSIBLY GET if we
are going to present this as our 2,000th Etext--if you know anyone who
can help find pre-1923 editions, or who is willing to help proofread--
I don't want to put this off. . .it is too good a choice. . .HELP!!!

***

Don Quixote in Spanish. . .we are not getting very far with this one--
we have only about two more months before we COULD post Etext #2000...
BUT...I am willing to put this off until 1/1/2000 if that's what it is
going to take to get something rolling.  I think it is very important,
more than I can say, to do more Etexts in more languages. . . .



B.  La Tulipe Noire in French

La Tulipe Noire, in French, by Alexandre Dumas. . .we have an Etext in
. . .but it needs some serious proofreading. . .we would LOVE to do an
entire series of Dumas in French and English, and others in French!

It is now possible to get any Gutenberg File via Email.  You simply send a
message to gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with your request in the
subject and the file is sent back as a MIME attachment.  Please note,
however, that your request must follow a specific syntax in order to be
fulfilled properly.  For a complete set of instructions send a message to
gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with the word and only the word "help" in
the subject.  That's help not Help or HELP.  Also, do not include the
quotes.  If you have any questions, feel free to Email
Aaron Cannon <cannona@fireantproductions.com>

Lets say that you want the book Marten Hyde.  Well that book is called
mhyde10.txt and it is in the etext98 directory.  To get via email, simply
send a message to gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with a subject line of
"get etext98 mhyde10.txt" without the quotes.  So your message would look
something like this:

From: you@yoursite.com
To: gutenberg@fireantproductions.com
Subject: get etext98 mhyde10.txt

The message body is ignored.

New this month:


Addition to our recent new releases of Shakespeare:
Jun 1999 Sir John Oldcastle, Shakespeare [Apocryphal]      [1ws5110x.xxx]1788

We have also fixed 1ws2610.* which were accidentally
saved as WordPerfect files rather than in PVASCII.
Those are in /etext97

We have also corrected thousands of errors in Etexts
over the past month or two while things were slowed
down over the holidays.  Of course, with approximately
2,000 Etexts, this represents only an average of a few
errors corrected in each one, but you will find more
corrections in those with filenames with higher numbers.
i.e. xxxxx11.txt will have major corrections from *10.txt
and xxxxxx12.txt will have major corrections from *11.txt,
and so on.  We hope you will continue to send us email of
any errors or suggestions.  We do not ALWAYS change the
version number when we make only a few correction, but
it might be worthwhile to download new copies once a year
or so, or to check the dates on the prairienet.org site
against the dates on your files. . .I don't think the
other sites keep our dates, sorry. . .except that the
.zip files should unzip to the real file dates.

AND VIEWERS FIGHT BACK AGAINST WEB AD OVERLOAD
Meanwhile, Web surfers weary of enduring the "pulsating, candy-colored wave
of advertising that has spread across the Internet," increasingly are
turning to ad-blocking software to speed up their download times.  "They are
a symbol of people saying, 'I'm not going to take it anymore,'" says Jakob
Nielsen, co-founder of the Nielsen-Norman Group.  The ad blockers, which
automatically eliminate all advertising from Web pages, go by names like
WebWasher, InterMute and AtGuard.  Many online advertisers dismiss the trend
toward ad-blocking, noting that when faster connections are available,
consumers will not be so annoyed about being forced to download cumbersome
advertisement files.  "Consumers understand the basic proposition that all
the free things are enabled by advertising," says the chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau.  "Advertising is transforming the business
model."  (Los Angeles Times 2 Mar 99)

OPEN UNIVERSITY OFFERS FIRST ONLINE COURSE
Britain's Open University, one of the oldest distance education institutions
in existence, this week launched its first online course -- "You, Your
Computer and the Net."  The course, which is designed for students with
little or no technical knowledge, has attracted 2,000 students, with one
senior O.U. lecturer calling the response "overwhelming."  Participants will
use a dedicated Web site and will have e-mail access to individual tutors.
The O.U. says the new course is aimed at those "who feel apprehensive about
the apparently inexorable march of the new communications technologies."

PREPARE FOR Y2K THE WAY YOU'D PREPARE FOR A THREE-DAY BLOW
Senator Chris Dodd's advice for getting ready for Y2K is:  "What you ought
to do is prepare for a good storm, a hurricane, a storm where you'd like two
or three days of water and canned goods and the like," but you shouldn't
withdraw your money from banks.  A study conducted by Dodd and Senator
Robert Bennett has concluded that there will be no major problems with
regard to the airways, nuclear weapons, or the nation's power grids.  (AP 1

HALF OF U.S. CLASSROOMS ARE NOW WIRED
The Department of Education says that, largely thanks to government
subsidies, 51% of classrooms, school computer and science labs, and school
libraries had Internet connections in the Fall of 1998 (compared to 27% in
1997 and only 3% in 1994).  Smaller and poorer schools are now just as
likely to have Internet connections as larger and wealthier schools.

300 days to the new Millennium, and still public estimates of the costs
have not yet reached the $1 Trillion mark I predicted when the Y2K bugs
were first announced. . .but I still predict at least that much cost.
