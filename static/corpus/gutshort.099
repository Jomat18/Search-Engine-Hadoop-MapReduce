****This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for December 10, 1998****
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

If you ever take the time to read this Newsletter beginning to the end
. . .this is probably the best time. . .there is a LOT of information,
for both those who just want to get our books, and, also for those who
want to help create those books.


This Newsletter is actually being posted November's first Wednesday in
response to the new United States copyright laws passed just last week
and is thus doing double duty; as the December 10th Newsletter is more
traditionally a venue for releasing some Etexts of the best classics--
which I most often dedicate to my father, who passed away December 10,
9 years ago, just after getting Project Gutenberg's initial supporter,
with one of his brilliant ideas that kept amazing me all of my life!!!

So. . .here is the biggest Project Gutenberg Newsletter of all time...
containing more Etexts than ever before, and, getting us more ahead of
schedule than ever before...with more people to contact about becoming
a Project Gutenberg volunteer than ever before, and even more. . . .

This has been a VERY hectic week, as I came back out of vacation mode,
just a week ago today, having posted only about 5 Etexts in 12 days of
vacation since our previous Newsletter, and in that one week we posted
all 31 Etexts left to complete the next month, as well as the 49 files
of our new, and more complete, AND PUBLIC DOMAIN, Shakespeare edition!
[During the writing of this Newsletter we have posted three more Etext
files for May, 1999, appended at the end of the lists.  We also should
be posting the newly revised copyrighted Shakespeare files any minute.
Sue and Greg may be sending you an independent Newsletter about those.

So. . .please forgive me if I have overdone or underdone anything here
. . .I am already 7 hours late in getting this posted as we speak.

Executive Director

0.  Late news items.

I [Michael Hart] will be hard to reach for the coming month, as I
will be meeting with a number of people, doing conferences, house
hunting in Tacoma, and all that stuff, and, hopefully taking rest
and refuge from everything to prepare to continue the fight for a
reversal of the new copyright laws in court.

So, in addition to emailing me at hart@pobox.com, you should also
cc:

Sue Asscher <asschers@aia.net.au>,
  or Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu> if you can't get to Sue

Sue and Greg will be posting the books while I am gone, and maybe
even sending out one of these Newsletters!

Please also be encouraged to contact:


Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>,  United States
David Price <ccx074@ccj.coventry.ac.uk>  England
John Bickers <jbickers@ihug.co.nz>  New Zealand

[But don't feel you can only contact the one who
is closest to you. . . .]

[We don't want Sue and Greg to be too inundated with everything.]
They are not nearly as used to this as are Dianne, David and John,
and I hope you will be as considerate of them all as possible.

Thanks!

Michael

For those who access our sites to get or send Etexts:

archive.org has been through a MAJOR crash as is not,
at least at this moment, fully recovered, so you may
want to try our other sites.  Email Sue and Newby to
find out where to send files if you have trouble.  I
note that sunsite.unc.edu is not accepting files for
the moment because the disk is full. . .more on this
in the Volunteers' Newsletter in a day or so.  Newby
just this minute let me know that archive.org is up,
at least for "outgoing" to send us files, but now it
requires a "cd work" command after FTPing in.  Newby
will try to get the /etext directories running ASAP,
so you can get the normal files from archive.org

[Right. . ."ootgoing" is now "outgoing" [cd work]!!!


1.

As usual, before we even get started, here are requests to
find certain books our volunteers would LOVE to work on:


The works of Francesca Franco [of "Dangerous Beauty" fame]
<cyri@juno.com> Tania


William Blake, The Four Zoas
We have someone who is willing to pay for part of the cost
of getting a copy of this. . .and will proofread.  You can
contact me directly about this one. . . .  If the price is
decent, just go ahead and get it if the copyright is 1922,
or earlier. . .but please don't ship it to me yet. . . .


Burton's Arabian Nights. . .for:
Ron Burkey <rburkey@heads-up.com>
Unabridged, dated before 1923 in
copyright or publication info.

and

Would anyone be interested in collecting up pieces of the Human
Genome to post on Project Gutenberg?  It is often requested.


Here is a list of our Directors of Production, please feel free
to contact them during the next month as I will be hard to get.

2.  While "the cat in the Cat in the Hat hat" is away, will mice play?

I will be hard to reach for the next month, hobnobbing with my fellow
wizards as I tend to do every year at this time.  I hope to come back
with some major support for Project Gutenberg, as I am aging quickly,
and surprised myself quite a bit with our huge rush of production for
the past three months.  It appears we have posted over 267 new files,
with some 216 of them as new editions, all in the past 92 days or so.
In fact, the 36 April Etexts, and all the new and revised Shakespeare
files were posted in the last two weeks. . .someday I hope we can get
that much work done EVERY two weeks!



3.  A first glance at the new copyright laws.

I was only a week ago that the new copyright laws were signed, and it
is my honor to tell you that our volunteers and supporters have great
will power when it comes to a call to arms.  The HUGE book production
over the past two weeks was actually nearly all posted in just 1 week
since this new law took effect.  [I had already gone into what I call
"vacation mode" after sending out the mid-month Newsletter, and, only
4 or 5 new books had been posted between the Newsletter and the law--
when I announce an effort to avenge the passing of the law by posting
as many books as possible for the next Newsletter, which would now be
set for only one week away, instead of six weeks away.

No way I can say NEARLY enough about our volunteers and directors, as
they really and truly CAME THROUGH IN A TIME OF CRISIS to let a world
know that we were not going to knuckle under to the pressure!

A tip of the hat to all of them!!

Now, on the legal matters.

At first glance, the major effect on the Public Domain is destruction
. . .plain and simple. . .for the next 20 years. . .and more, if they
pass another such law, which, I am sure they will try their damnedest
to do. . .THERE WILL BE NO MORE PUBLIC DOMAIN BOOKS IN THE U.S. other
than the ones that had already entered the Public Domain on 1/1/1998.

Even if such a law is NOT passed again and again, the Public Domain a
person might have gotten used to living in this century will only "be
a distant memory before Orwell's Age of 1984" in that a Public Domain
that used to include approximately HALF or 50% of all materials of an
eternity of publishing up to 100 years ago, should now include nearly
0% of the all the materials that will have been published in history,
up to 100 years from now.

Let me put this succinctly:

100 years ago the U.S. Public Domain included about 50% of everything

100 years from now the U.S. Public Domain will include about 0%. .

Here's the simple math:

If copyrighted information doubles every 14 years, and the copyright
usually expires in 14 years, then information is flowing into public
domain access at the same rate it is flowing into copyright. . .so a
quick look tells us that during the time it took to create a world's
new supply of information, the old supply of information came out of
copyright and into the Public Domain. . . .

100 years ago [and up to 1909] the average copyright lasted about 15
years, with most books having 14 years of copyright monopoly and the
copyrights were not renewed, because the books weren't selling after
about 5 years, on the average, for the books that were good enough a
library would have purchased them.  This is still true today. . .you
steal or lose a book over 5 years from a library and the odds are it
cannot be replaced because it has gone out of print.

Since information was doubling just about every 14 years back then--
the result was that half of all information was in the Public Domain
. . .which isn't such a terrible way to have it be. . .the powerful,
the rich, etc., can still have twice as much as those who mostly use
free information.

In my interview last week with the New York Times, the interviewer's
suggestion was that we consider current information to be doubling a
bit faster. . .every 7 years.

If the average copyright were still just over 14 years today, we see
that 75% or 3/4 of all information would still be copyrighted.

The faster information flows through our society, the more is hidden
from the Public Domain by copyrights of the same length.

Under the new copyright law, the average copyright will be nearly an
entire century in length, with no renewals required, and copyrighted
notices are no longer required. . .it will be nearly impossible from
the average person's point of view, to tell whether anything is in a
copyrighted or public domain status, and, it will take some research
to find out. . .this alone is enough to stop most public domain use.

However, even AFTER doing all the copyright research, the struggling
"New Age Public Domain Information Providers" will find that none of
the materials they research will be in the Public Domain. . .none in
the sense that the number will be closer to 0% than to 1%. . .closer
by a HUGE margin to 0% than to 1%.

If the New York Times' estimates of 7 years for information doubling
may be considered at all correct, then this is what will happen in a
United States under the new copyright law, even if we considered 100
percent of current information to the entered into the Public Domain
as an incentive to let this law stand:

 0 years. . .100% of today's information is in the Public Domain
 7 years. . . 50% of today's information is in the Public Domain
14 years. . . 25% of today's information is in the Public Domain
21 years. . . 12.5% of today's information is in the Public Domain
28 years. . .  6.25% of today's information is in the Public Domain
35 years. . .  3.125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
42 years. . .  1.5625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
49 years. . .  0.78125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
56 years. . .  0.390625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
63 years. . .  0.1953125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
70 years. . .  0.09765625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
77 years. . .  0.048828125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
84 years. . .  0.0244140625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
91 years. . .  0.01220703125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
98 years. . .  0.006103515625% of today's information is in the Public Domain

This is literally just one book out of some 10,000 books that will be
in the Public Domain after about 95 years of a 95 year copyright even
if information does NOT continue to increase faster and faster. . . .

Many people think information is ALREADY doubling faster than 7 years
for each doubling, but all that does is make the total reach 0.00001%
etc., etc., etc.

And you though Big Brother had a thing for monopolizing information.

This is the beginning of

The Information Wars

Since they can no longer stop us from talking to each other via email
or etext or the Web, or FTP, etc., they are passing laws that tell us
we cannot include 99.99% of all the information in the world, because
it is not all protected by copyright.

One last word about the new copyright law. . . .

I plan to be in court as soon as possible as a test case to defeat it
once and for all. . .wish me luck!


4.  The 36 Project Gutenberg Etexts for April, 1999.

We have chosen, with great effort and glee, to present what many call
the greatest epic of all time as our lead story this month. . .in two
separate translations. . .The Odyssey, by Homer.

We are also including more Plato and Socrates, O Henry, H. Rider Haggard, and
B. M. Bower, as well as several more G. K Chestertons, Balzacs, Conrads, etc.
including some of Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Bronte.  We also included a bit
more Mary Roberts Rinehart and Jules Verne.

We hope you enjoy reading these as much as we enjoy bringing them to you.

5.  The 49 NEW Project Gutenberg Complete Works of Shakespeare,
    this one is in the Public Domain, at least in the U.S.

Remember:  these are in /etext98, we reserved the slots for them
before we got on the HUGE production run that doubled the Etexts
coming out over the past three months. . .during this period our
volunteers have created about 266 Etext files for you to read.

The revised versions of our OLD Shakespeare are done and will be
announced. . .I just don't have the filenames for them. . .since
we didn't release them as separate files back in 1994, we cannot
just put them in /etext94 as updates to old filenames.  This may
mean they will have to appear as June and July, 1999 Etexts; the
April Etexts are all done, and we may have already started May.

6.   The NEWLY REVISED editions of our 100th Etext, the copyrighted
    version of Shakespeare's works. . .1,000s of errors corrected!

These will likely be in /etext99, stay tuned for Newsletters from
Sue and Greg about these.

The filenames will be same as above only instead of starting with
a 2 or 3, they will start with 1, and the revision number is 11:

so 2ws0110.txt and .zip are the NEW Public Domain edition of Henry
as listed above in /etect98
and 1ws0111.txt and .zip will be the revised [11] old copyrighted edition
in /etext94 and the new files will be in /etext99

If you have any problems finding these on your own, you can ask
Sue Asscher, listed above, how to find them.  If you are using
an index, don't forget that it takes our indexers quite a while
to get this many etext indexed, so you might want learn how to
use FTP, or the FTP functions in your browers, to get them now.

Remember:  if you get these files directly, without a "point and click"
you will need to go to three different directories:

April will be in /etext99
The NEW Shakespeare will be in /etext98
The revised versions from Etext #100 will be in /etext99
The original version of Etext #100 is still in /etext94
Etext #100 was originally released on December 10, 1993,
for an official release date of January, 1994.
Hard to believe we have posted 1628 Etexts since then,
an average of nearly one Etext per day.  [Literally ~.9]



7.  Who is "the cat in the Cat in the Hat hat," anyway?  Or what?

I am pictured as the 2nd in the list of the Wired 25 for 1998 and
since I don't like having my picture taken, I tend to clown a bit
for the camera to make it more exciting. . .so I am sitting in my
chair in the middle of a country road through the cornfields with
a "long-stemmed American Beauty" between my teeth. . .well you'll
understand when/if you see the picture. . .and I'm wearing my own
trademark red t-shirt with a "Cat in the Hat" hat. . . .

OK, let's make it brief, I often either break into a sweat or may
seem too self-important when these things come up. . . .

First. . .please let me remind you that I probably do less than 1
percent of the work it takes to do Project Gutenberg; maybe less,
when I consider how many Project Gutenberg sites there are that I
don't even know about, and probably never will.

I accept any awards to Project Gutenberg, or myself, on behalf of
all of our volunteers, past, present and future and I forward all
the "Thank You Notes" I get, whether via email or snailmail on to
the entire list of volunteers on our listserver.

I tried to get WIRED to give this award to Project Gutenberg as a
whole:  and you probably don't want to hear the whole story about
that. . . .

To make a long story short Wired finally seems to have bought the
tickets to send me to the award banquet to receive "The WIRED 25"
award, for which they commisioned a world famous architect, and I
also get a pair of tennis shoes, a hotel room, and a limo, to and
from LAX. . .I promise to enjoy it all as much as possible in the
honor of all our volunteers.

"THOSE WHO DARE
  THE WIRED 25
  A SALUTE TO:
   DREAMERS,
  INVENTORS,
  MAVERICKS,
   LEADERS"

"Life is short.

"Especially when you're determined to break all the rules."

If you want to read the rest, I suppose I should encourage
you to go out and buy the November issue of Wired. . .it says
THE WIRED 25 right in the middle of the cover, can't miss it.
The first half of my name is obscured by the 25. . . .

IT'S OFFICIAL:  NEW NAME FOR NT 5.0.
The next-gen OS becomes "Windows 2000."
They are trying to get it out before 2000.

MICROSOFT SAYS IT WAS NETSCAPE THAT SUGGESTED A DEAL
In the antitrust suit against Microsoft, Microsoft has introduced a December
1994 e-mail message from Netscape chairman James Clark as evidence that it
was Netscape rather than Microsoft that first suggested an arrangement to
illegally restrain trade.  Clark had written to a Microsoft executive:  "We
have never planned to compete with you.  We want to make this company a
success, but not at Microsoft's expense.  We'd like to work with you.
Working together could be in your self-interest as well as ours.  Depending
on the interest level, you might take an equity position in Netscape, with
the ability to expand the position later."  He added:  "No one in my
organization knows about this message."  A Microsoft attorney yesterday
asked Netscape president James Barksdale of Netscape chairman and cofounder
James Clark:  "Do you regard him as a truthful man?"  Barksdale paused and
then replied:  "I regard him as a salesman."  The Microsoft attorney said:
"I'm not going to touch that." (New York Times 22 Oct 98)


ANOTHER TRY AT FREE NET SERVICE
NetZero Inc. is offering free Internet service to consumers, operating on an
advertising-based business model.  The company isn't selling your typical
banner ad, however.  NetZero's banners can "follow" users from site to site
as they peruse the Web.  The company says it's spent a year developing
software that tracks users' habits, enabling advertisers to pinpoint their
messages more efficiently.  "We can target within a 12-mile radius of where
(a subscriber) lives," says NetZero's CEO.  Idealab Capital Partners, which
is backing the venture, thinks subscribers will like the free access despite
the ads.  "People are spending $21.95 a month for AOL -- that's a lot of
money," says Idealab's managing director.  "We offer a value proposition
that's hard to beat."  (Investor's Business Daily 19 Oct 98)

"GRASSROOTS" LOBBY EFFORT ROOTED AT AT&T
The Prince George's Coalition Against Hidden Taxes, supposedly a grassroots
lobbying effort organized in Maryland, has been revealed to be a massive
effort by AT&T to defeat proposed legislation that would charge a fee of 3%
of gross revenues generated by telecom companies seeking to use public
rights of way to lay cable, string wire, or plant cellular towers to provide
new services.  AT&T considers the legislation unfair because it singles out
telecommunications companies from other users of public land, such as
sanitary commissions and gas & electric companies.  Calling the Coalition's
media campaign a "massive fraud," the Prince George's County chief executive
said, "This isn't any citizens coalition.  This is a bunch of giant
companies trying to profit off the public for free."  (Washington Post 24
Oct 98)

E-BOOKS TO COME SINGING DOWN THE WIRE
Saying that "if you can get to the Web, you can buy a book -- instantly,"
the chief executive of NuvoMedia unveiled his company's paperback-size,
22-ounce $499 electronic Rocket eBook at Barnes & Noble, the bookstore and
publishing company that will make titles available for downloading onto a
personal computer.  Books will sell for $18 to $25, and downloading of a
book will take 2 to 5 minutes.  Tapping a button will allow the reader to
scroll through the book, which will include a built-in dictionary and allow
electronic underlining, note-taking, word search, and font changes.
Generally similar products are being developed by other manufacturers,
including SoftBook Press and Everybook Inc.  (AP 23 Oct 98)
