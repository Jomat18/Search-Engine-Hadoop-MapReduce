This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, February 3, 1999
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

This Newsletter contains index entries for Etexts up to #1900 and thus
Project Gutenberg has now completed about 19% of its primary goal of a
production and distribution run of 10,000 easy to use Etexts.

We are hoping to do a Spanish edition of Don Quixote for #2000, but we
need your help.  If you have any old editions of Don Quixote or know a
person or institution that does, please let me know.  We don't need to
scan from the book, but we need one to do our copyright research from!

***

Our newest site:

www.gutenberg.cyberxs.nl/
An ISP for younger internet users runs their own mirror.
They hope to soon have the site search-engine enabled.

Requests for assistance from our volunteers:

My sources show Legge "published monumental edition of
"Chinese Classics", with translation, prolegomena, and
notes [28 vols, 1861-86].  by James Legge  Please reply
to me and to Rick Davis <rdavis@yin.or.jp>

"Does anyone have access to a first edition of 'Alps and Sanctuaries
of Piedmont and the Canton Ticino)' by Samuel Butler?  I need to know
what was in chapter X and also the last few paragraphs of the book.
Any help would be appreciated, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk"  David Price

"Help Wanted:   I am in the process of typing out the collection of Samuel
Adams'  writings gathered by H. A. Cushing (copyrighted 1904) and putting
them on the web.  Unfortunately, I do not own this collection, and must
borrow it through the interlibrary loan.  If anybody who either owns this work
or can get it through your interlibrary loan system is interested in helping
with this project, please contact me at: Regina Azucena <razucena@gis.net>
so that we can coordinate the work.  Also if anyone has access to a scanner
with OCR, this would be especially helpful, since at present I am typing by
hand and the work is rather slow.  The collection preserves the original
spelling of Samuel Adams which is not at all uniform, and this makes the
typing slower.  I would be happy to find out for you if the collection is
available through a library in your area."

Announcement:  Lextek International has released
an ebook viewer called InfoBlast designed to work
especially with the ebooks produced by Project
Gutenberg and several of the other online book
projects.

InfoBlast will index the ebook files letting
users conduct keyword, phrase, proximity, and wildcard
searches.  (InfoBlast can index literally 100's of
megabytes quickly so no matter how big your ebook(s)
are it is easy to set them up for searching.)

You can also bookmark passages of text using InfoBlast
making them easy to find again.  Searches are also saved as
a history so you can easily go back to your past searches.
InfoBlast has links to a number of the largest ebook download
sites on the net (including Gutenberg.net) where you can
freely obtain ebooks to use with InfoBlast.

InfoBlast is available for download from:

E-MAIL RESPONSES AT A SNAIL'S PACE
A recent survey of Fortune 100 companies by e-mail software firm Brightware
shows that many respondents allow e-mail to languish for days before
responding to it.  Four companies took a full week to respond to the
question, "What is your corporate headquarters address?"  (In one case,
Hewlett-Packard took 23 days.)  Rapid responders included Texaco, which
responded within four minutes, and Albertson's and Costco, both of which
responded within five minutes.  Overall, fewer than 15% responded within
three hours, and 26% either did not accept e-mail or made it so difficult to
find e-mail information on their Web sites that a typical user probably
would give up looking.  (Los Angeles Times 18 Jan 99)

INTEL FLIPS SWITCH ON PENTIUM III'S I.D. FEATURE
Responding to concerns by critics that the new Pentium III chip's unique
serial number will allow the monitoring of an individual's moves throughout
cyberspace, Intel has decided to alter the software so that the ID
capability will be turned off unless the customer voluntarily turns it on to
make a secure e-commerce transaction. (The original plan was to have the
feature turned on unless the user took the trouble to turn it off.)  But
privacy advocates are not satisfied, and want the ID feature entirely
disabled.  Deirdre Mulligan of the Center for Democracy and Technology says,
"If everybody's demanding it, it's going to be hard for a consumer to say
no."  (San Jose Mercury News 26 Jan 99)

LINUX USERS WANT THEIR MONEY BACK FROM MICROSOFT
Aficionados of the Linux operating system, which is available for free, say
they will demand their money back for Windows software installed against
their wishes on PCs they buy.  Their demand is based on a Windows licensing
agreement that says that if the purchaser does not agree to the terms and
conditions of use of the Windows software, he or she should promptly contact
manufacturer for instructions on return of the unused product for a refund.
Microsoft says that agreement applies only to the issues surrounding the of
making copies of the software.  (New York Times 25 Jan 99)

JUDGE EXTENDS BAN ON ENFORCEMENT OF CHILD PORN LAW
U.S. District Court Judge Lowell A. Reed has extended his temporary ban on
enforcement of the Child Online Protection Act, and signaled in a lengthy
memorandum that he considers the act an unconstitutional violation of First
Amendment rights of free speech.  To protect children from pornography
transmitted through cyberspace, the federal Child Online Protection Act
requires operators of commercial Web sites offering potentially
objectionable material to establish a system to prevent minors from viewing
that material.  Judge Reed, a Reagan appointee, wrote: "Despite the Court's
personal regret that this preliminary injunction will delay once again the
careful protection of our children, I without hesitation acknowledge the
duty imposed on the Court and the great good such duty serves. Indeed,
perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First Amendment
protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are chipped away in the
name of their protection."  (San Jose Mercury News 2 Feb 99)

ACTING DUMB, OR AT LEAST LEARNING IMPAIRED, GETS THE BIG BUCKS

Last night, Feb. 3, one of the major networks did an expose on
the practice of the residents of Greenwich, Connecticut] which
is perhaps best known as the richest community in the USA], of
having their students get extra funding, extra tutoring, extra
exam time [even on the SATs], by the simple expedient of dumb,
or as it is politically correctly stated, "learning impaired,"
"learning disabled," etc.  In addition to the above, they also
get special entitlement and money for tuition that is cut out
of the budgets for the rest of the students of Connecticut or/
and their regional school districts.  If you have any details,
or corroborations, please let us know, as our information came
from sketchy notes taken from the live evening news broadcast.
Connecticut was/is famous in this area for once having, at the
same time, the highest per capita income AND the lowest amount
spent per student in their public schools, possibly because of
a trend to send all the rich kids to private schools, and then
to refuse to fund the public schools.  This should also have a
corroboration, as I heard it from a Connecticut teacher.

Speaking of corroboration, I received a number of statements a
"modem tax" as many seemed to call ANY fee associated with the
increased phone rates for using modems, never has happened.  I
can tell you from my personal experience that I have been at a
college where their telco actually charged for an entire extra
line wherever any modem was installed.  Apparently, they had a
system that allowed voice ONLY on "normal" lines so the charge
could not be avoided.  Apparently our local telcos have tried,
and failed, to get additional modem charges as well.  But that
note about the national bills for similar things apparently is
a hoax. . .my apologies. . .I got it from someone I have known
for years. . .and who will get an extra copy of this as email.

***

And last, but certainly not least:  for those of you receiving
email from the LIBREF listserver about "Censorship," and "Free
Speech," and a few other related topics. . .the reason you did
not hear more about these is because my remarks, and, so I was
told, those of several others, were. . .how to best put this:

"Censored. . . !"

My own censored remarks were only four lines replying to being
compared to Austin Powers and other similar remarks, in which,
I must say, I showed admirable restraint in NOT replying to an
assortment of comments in bad taste, but only stating that the
truth was that I am proud to be from the 60's, and of what the
people of the 60's did; I won't repeat those simple four lines
here, even if it may be true that their censors don't very far
down toward the bottom of longer messages.  However I will say
that I did resend the note a second time, in response to their
anonymous note saying they were putting an end to a discussion
that had only had a half dozen notes over three days; I resent
[this time a different word than resend] such anonymous notes,
hiding behind the "moderator" login, and complained that their
taste in posting the obviously in bad taste Austin Powers note
was only exceeded by their refusing to post my very short, and
very moderate reply.  BTW, the last time LIBREF hosted message
relays about free speech, the same thing happened, in terms of
anonymous censorship.  When I complained, they posted the note
that had been censored, then, as I recall, still wanted to end
the discussion with me having the last word.  I send them that
famous quote about:

I may not agree with what is being said, but I will defend, to
the death, their right to say it.

They finally decided to let the conversation go on its own and
the result was that it ended soon enough and simply enough w/o
any interference from the "listowners" rather than moderators.

I wonder if we will have to go through all that again. . . .mh

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]


You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks!!
