Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do usually do NOT! keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

We need your donations more than ever!

EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF WILLIAM BRAY

by William Bray




These extracts are printed for the gratification of Mr. Bray's
descendants; who will see in them a remarkable instance of a life
of sociability and amusement, combined with great and successful
industry.

More extracts would have only shewn the same activity and pursuits.



MEMOIR



Mr. Bray was born at Shere, on the 15th of November, 1736.  He was
the youngest of the three sons who survived their father Edward
Bray, Esq.  George the eldest, who was in the Church, and the
second son Edward, who was in the Army, both died unmarried; and,
on the death of George the survivor, in 1803, Mr. Bray succeeded to
the possession of the Manors of Shere and Gumshall, which had
belonged to his ancestors from the reign of Henry the Eighth.  When
ten years old he was placed at Rugby, where he remained until he
was articled to Mr. Martyr, an Attorney of Guildford.  In 1761, he
was appointed a Clerk of the Board of Green Cloth, at St. James's,
through the patronage of Sir John Evelyn.  His attendance at the
Board did not prevent his practising as an Attorney, and it
introduced him to many clients.  In 1777, he published a 'Tour in
Derbyshire and Yorkshire,' and a second edition of it in 1783.  In
1797, he was chosen one of the Council, and a few years afterwards
Treasurer, of the Society of Antiquaries, many of his
communications to which are printed in the 'Archaeologia.'  In
1801, on the death of the Revd. Mr. Manning, who had been engaged
for some years in compiling the 'History of Surrey,' Mr. Bray
undertook to complete the work.  The first volume was published in
1804, the second in 1809, and the third in 1814.  His next and last
literary undertaking was the editing of the 'Evelyn Memoirs,' which
he completed in 1817. {1}  Although in his 80th year, he
transcribed in his own handwriting nearly the whole of Mr. Evelyn's
Journal.

He died from weakness, and without any disorder, on the 21st of
December, 1832, having entered his 97th year on the 15th of the
preceding month.

His habits before marriage did not promise either an industrious or
a very long life.  He spent almost every night at cards, and many
of his mornings in other amusements.  After his marriage he became
more attentive to his professional business; but he continued for
many years to live more like a bachelor than a married man,
spending most of his evenings in the society of his numerous
friends, or at a coffee-house.  He was very hospitable both in bed
and board, but in the plainest way.  His surplus income was laid
out in purchases at Shere and in planting, and he left no personal
property except his life insurances.  The family estate devolved on
his death to his grandson Edward, who lived at Shere, and died in
1866, at the age of 72.

MEMORANDA



1806, Nov. 15th.--This day, I completed my 70th year, without
having ever met with any accident of consequence and with very
little interruption to my health, except in January last, when I
had a very serious attack by an inflammation in my lungs, but from
which I am perfectly recovered.  My eyesight is so good that I can
and generally do use my eyes in reading or writing from the time of
getting up in the morning till 10 at night.  My hearing is in no
way impaired.  I have not lost one front tooth and very few others.
I am able to walk or ride 4 or 5 hours together, but I do not ride
fast.  My memory is perhaps not so good as it has been.  On the
whole I seem to be in a perfect good state of health, thanks be to
God.

1808, Nov. 15th.--This day I completed my 72nd year; and thanks to
God's mercies I find myself in as perfect health as I ever enjoyed
in my life, and the only perceivable difference in any of my senses
that I am aware of is a little degree of deafness in my right ear,
but as the other is perfect, I do pretty well.  My left eye I think
has not perfectly recovered the severe inflammation which I had two
or three years ago, but the other being sound, I read and write as
well and as much as ever.  My teeth remain perfect in front and
without any additional loss to those which decayed some years ago.

1810, April 5th.--I quitted the Board of Green Cloth, after having
had a place there for 49 years and a half.  I was put on the
superannuation list at my request, the Lord Steward having kindly
procured leave for it.  He also, unsolicited, gave me leave to
resign my place of Clerk of the Verge to my son.

Nov. 14th.--After dinner, I found a giddiness in my head making me
unable to walk, and a kind of dumb confusion in my head.  I wrote
to Mr. Heaviside to come, which he did and ordered immediate
cupping. {108}  The next morning my complaint was gone.

1814, May 30th.--Received from Mr. Sydenham Malthus the melancholy

{2}  Whom he afterwards married.  She was the daughter of Mr.
Stevens, of Perry Hill, Worplesdon, and lived with her aunt, Mrs.
Norwood, at Guildford.  She was two years older than Mr. Bray, who
was then only two months past 19.

{3}  Mr. Flutter and his brother were Mayors of Guildford more than
once, and the name of Flutter appears twice in the list of Mayors
in the reign of Charles II.

{4}  A lad of nineteen.

{9}  The medical charge for the inoculation was 4 pounds 4s.

{10}  He had very little to do at Mr. Martyr's.  In the summer he
was often at the Bowling-green, and took long walks with his
friends, male and female.  It was not required that any married
lady should join the walking parties.

{11}  A Hessian regiment was quartered at Guildford for some time.
Their band was a great attraction.

{12}  An attorney at Guildford.  Grandfather of the Rev. John
Chandler.

{13}  Being of age and out of his articles to Mr. Martyr, he went
to London, and took lodgings there.  Mr. Adderley, of New Inn,
received him in his chambers for instruction in his profession, but
his attendance there was not regular.

{14}  Mr. Jenkins was in Mr. Adderley's office, and afterwards
entered into partnership with Mr. Bray.  Mr. James was also in the
same office.

{15}  He went to his French master for some months, an hour at a
time; not regularly.

{16}  About this time he bought many books, all at low prices, at
stalls and auctions.

{17}  Playing at cards almost every night, and always for coin, he
had a purse on purpose.

{18}  Whilst at Guildford he lodged at Baptist's for 7s. a week.
He dined at the 'White Hart,' for 10d.

{19}  He sold this stock to pay 23 pounds 12s. 6d. for Viner's
'Abridgment of the Law.'

'White Hart' and the 'Tuns,' and 6s. a week for his lodgings in the
town.

{25}  Miss Adee and Betsy Stevens were the bridesmaids.

{26}  Mrs. C.'s was the lodging Mr. Jenkins had taken for him in
Lothbury.

{28}  They received friends to tea every evening this week.  They
lived in a house with a garden, in which Mr. Bray planted fruit
trees and shrubs, but where it was does not appear in the Diary.

{29}  He went to the Bowling-green to play at whist in the winter,
and at howls in the summer.

{30}  He had been the first performance of Marplot by Garrick.

{31}  When he took the horse as far as Dorking it was 2s. 6d.

{32}  The son of the Member for the County.

{33}  Mr.  Godschall, of Weston House, Albury.  An accomplished
gentleman, LL.D. of Oxford, cousin of Lady Palmerston, the mother
of the late Lord Palmerston.

{34}  Of Parkhurst, where Rousseau was his guest for some time.

{35}   Who built the Leith Hill Tower, and was buried there.

{36}  It is remarkable that a young attorney of 22 should have been
invited to the social meetings of elderly and middle-aged gentlemen
of the highest position in the neighbourhood.  His grandson, the
late Mr. Edward Bray, inherited his companionable qualities, and
was welcome in every house he visited.

{37}  The Member for the County.

{38}  Of Betchworth Castle.  The author of 'The Light of Nature.'

{39}  The father of the late Sir Henry Austen.  He had been
articled, as well as Mr. Bray, to Mr. Martyr.  He afterwards
purchased a Clerkship in the Six Clerks' Office in Chancery.

{40}  Mr. Bray's marriage made little difference in his habits this
year.  He was almost every night with his friends at cards or
backgammon; in the summer evenings at bowls; frequently at the
morning services on week days at the Middle Church.  He had very
little to do at this time in his profession.

{41}  Mr. Lane, of East Horsley Park.

{42}  Mr. Evelyn, afterwards Sir John, then M.P. for Helstone, had
offered him an appointment at the Board of Green Cloth, which he at
first, by the wish of his wife, declined to accept; but a few days
afterwards, being better advised, he was glad to find that he could
still have it.  The following note was among the Memoranda which he
left of his early life.--'Nothing could be pleasanter than our
situation at the Board of Green Cloth.  The Principals were all
members of the House of Commons.  We sat in the same room, at the
same green cloth table, with them, by whom we were treated rather
as associates than as clerks.'  Mr. Bray was at first only an
assistant, together with Mr. Selwyn, a barrister, afterwards in
large practice; Mr. Blenman, also of the Bar, and Mr. Fanshawe, but
they rose to be chief clerks.  His usual attendance was from 11 to
3.  He took a house in Holles Street, and settled there December
14th, but in the following year he moved to Great Russell Street.

{43}  This child died in July,

{44} After a Royal birth caudle was given to the Clerks of the
Green Cloth and others in office at St. James's.

Malthus, was the great writer on Population.  His youngest daughter
married Mr. Bray's son Edward.

{47}  His son Edward, who married Miss Malthus, and left a large
family.  His other sons died in childhood.  Mr. Bray had no
collateral relations of his name after the death of his uncle and
brothers within many generations.  His ancestor, Sir Edward Bray,
was the heir male of Edmund, Lord Bray, and succeeded to the family
estates; but the title descended to Lord Bray's daughters, and was
in abeyance until obtained by the late Baroness Bray.  Mr. Bray was
one of the few descendants then living of Sir Thomas More, whose
granddaughter, the daughter of Margaret Roper, married Sir Edward
Bray.  His two daughters, Mary and Catherine, were not married.

{48}  He was now getting into the society of literary men.

{49}  Afterwards Admiral Brodrick.

{50}  He had entered into partnership with his friend Mr. Jenkins,
whose chambers were in New Inn.

{51}  The Guildford Races were then in May.

{52}  Mr. Sturt was a barrister, and a relation of Mr. Bray's.  Mr.
Budgen, Mr. Talbot, and Mr. Scawen, were trustees of the charity.

{53}  A tour with Mr. Jenkins to Oxford, Bath, Gloucester,
Salisbury, Blenheim, Fonthill, Longleat, Chepstow, &c.  They hired
a carriage and horses for the journey; and, in a rhyming letter to
his wife, he writes:-


'We hired from friend Bryant a very good chaise,
Intending thus travelling quite at our ease.
James was mounted behind on a fine prancing steed,
To take care of the baggage and help us if need.'


Mr. Bray wrote a particular description of Fonthill, Stourton, and
other houses visited.

{54}  Some of his intimate friends dined with him every week.  The
dinner was over at 5 or 6, and he often went afterwards to a
coffee-house.  He also went frequently to the theatres, and
sometimes in the summer to Vauxhall.  His mornings were spent at
the Board of Green Cloth or in New Inn.

{55}  The house which Mr. Jacobson built, called 'Lonesome,' has
been pulled down.

{56}  Mr. Bray went to many different coffee-houses, but most
frequently to the Percy and Mundy's.  On Sundays he went for an
hour to the Buffalo.

{57}  He had a house at Shere, which his mother lived in, and made
a home for him during his frequent visits, and at little expense,
for riding round in the neighbourhood he got his dinner at one
house and tea at another.  To general information he could now add
the gossip of St. James's, and he was welcome wherever he went.

{58}  He kept what he called a chaise or whisky, and two horses.

{59}  Mr. Penneck was Keeper of the Reading-room at the British
Museum and Rector of Abinger.

{60}  Betchworth Castle.

{61}  He had become acquainted with Dr. Osborn and Dr. Price on the
institution of the Equitable Assurance Office, of which he was a
director.  He frequently rode with his friends, sometimes a party
of six.

{62}  He wrote a most particular description of it.

{63}  Mr. Planta, Principal Librarian at the British Museum.

{64}  This was the tour that he published an account of.  He rode
on horseback 1,800 miles this year.

{65}  This was a society which met at St. Paul's Coffee House.  The
subscription was five guineas a year.

{66}  This plantation sowed all the fir trees between the Windmill
and Pislake.  Another plantation adjoining to the West Churt, sowed
all the ground west of the road to Cranley.

{67}  This was for his father.

Pointers.

{74}  When he was in the country he seldom dined at home unless he
had friends with him.

{75}  His partnership with Mr. Jenkins was dissolved in 1774, but
without any interruption of their friendship.

{76}  To near the end of his life he would often stop to dine, and
sometimes to sleep, at the inn at Dorking, or Guildford, instead of
going home to Shere.

{77}  His only surviving son Edward was at Harrow.

{78}  These were all eminent antiquaries.

{79}  He was one of the Trustees of the British Museum.

{80}  He was subject all his life to inflammatory disorder, and
frequently took physic.

{81}  He went to Church every Sunday, but he did not think it wrong
to use his carriage and horses, or to travel on that day.  Mr.
Polhill, the Rector of Albury, used to go to church in his
carriage.

{82}  Abinger Hall.  Afterwards Lady Donegal's.

{83}  Mr. Rice was lord of the Manor of Tooting.

{84}  The Eaten Bray estate was inherited by Mr. Bray's ancestor,
Sir Edward Bray, as heir male of Lord Bray, and sold by him.

{85}  They became clients, and the family have remained among the
best clients of Mr. Bray's firm.

{86}  Sir Joseph Mawbey was member for Surrey;made a fortune by a
distillery.  Mr. Briscoe derived the manor of Epsom from his
daughter.

{87}  Mr. Malthus had left the Rookery, and was living at Albury,
in the house afterwards Colonel Clive's.

{94}  One of his usual rounds of visiting.

{95}  The dinner hour in London was getting later.

{96}  Of Burford Bridge.

{97}  For the following nine days there is no entry but 'At home.'

{98}  These eight consecutive days were spent in society.  When in
London he dined every week at the 'Crown and Anchor' with his
antiquary friends, and often received them to dinner.  He played at
whist still, but not so often.

{99}  Sir Peter Burrell married the Baroness Willoughby of Eresby,
and was made Lord Gwydir.  He and his descendants were among the
best clients of Mr. Bray's office.

{100}  The thermometer fell one and a half degree below zero.

{101}  As one of the Clerks at the Board of Green Cloth he had to
collect the land tax from the Officers of State.  He received 520
pounds from Lord Grenville for four quarters' land tax, at 4s. in
the pound; from the Duke of Portland, 923 pounds; Mr. Pitt, two
quarters, 456 pounds 15s.; Lord Thurlow, do., 1,425 pounds 17s.

{103}  Afterwards Dean of Ripon.

{104}  Rector of Clapham.

{105}  Father of the great builder.

{106}  Afterwards Dean of Canterbury.

{107}  He was confined to the house for more than a week by a bad
cold, which was followed by inflammation in one of his eyes.  The
inflammation was subdued with difficulty by the great oculist Mr.
Phipps, afterwards Sir Watken Waller.  The eye affected became
gradually weaker, and the sight of it was entirely gone for some
years before his death, although exactly when he did not notice.
At the beginning of the 19th century he was 64; and his son's
attention to the business of the office in Great Russell Street
enabled him to live more at Shere, but when in London his habits
were little changed.  He dined with the Antiquaries' Club almost
every week during the season until he was 90.  He did not so
frequently take his meals at the houses of his friends, but at his
own table they were always welcome, and many came.

{108}  He was frequently bled according to the usual practice in
those days.  He was bled the last time when he was 84.

{109}  Mr. Bray cared very little for politics, but he was not a
Tory, and would not have voted for Mr. Summer if he had not
represented the county for many years and been much respected.

{110}  Mr. Bray was within a few weeks of 90.  He took no servant
with him.

{111}  After this shameful affair, neither Mr. Taylor his clerk,
nor Mr. Wigzell had any communications with Mr. Bray or his
partners; but as a mark of repentance Mrs. Wigzell left Mr. Bray's
grandson a legacy of 100 pounds, and Mr. Taylor left 100 pounds to
the firm of Bray and Warren.

{112}  Principal Librarian at the British Museum; afterwards Sir
Henry Ellis.  He was Mr. Bray's oldest friend then living.  He died
in 1868 at a very advanced age, having during his long life
rendered most valuable services to the public, and particularly by
his contributions to English history.

{113}  Mr. Higgins was employed by Mr. Bray in writing for him.
His last guest at Shere was his old friend Mr. Carlisle, one of the
Secretaries of the Antiquary Society, who came to Shere on
Saturday, the 28th of October, and remained till Monday.  His
grandson Reginald was with him for a day or two every week, and
played at piquette with him three days before his death, which took
place on the 21st.
