New and reposted files:

Jul 1998 Anna Karenina, by Leo Tolstoy/Tolstoi [Tolstoy #5][nkrnnxxx.xxx]1399

This file was never completed, and should have been released as version 09 as
it is now named, and the completed file [now spellchecked] is version 10.  We
also hope to have a version 11 with an even more thorough proofreading, soon.

Apr 1999 The Survivors of the Chancellor, by Jules Verne #8[tsotcxxa.xxx]1698

This is from a different source than our previous edition  [tsotcxxx.xxx]1652
[My apologies, I thought I posted this a long time ago, but it never made it]


****Requests for Assistance from our Volunteers****

*

We need a pre-1923 edition of the Velveteen Rabbit,
or one that SAYS in it that it is a reprint of one.

*

Below is a sample from a German play by Goethe, Iphigenie
auf Taurus.  This material in its entirety will be
available shortly and will need a German-speaking
proofreader.  I am requesting a volunteer to take on the
challenge and assist in the final phase of this project.
Kindly contact me (globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com) if you can
offer aid.  Thanks!  Mike Pullen


F|nfter Aufzug.


Erster Auftritt.

Thoas.  Arkas.

Arkas.
Verwirrt mu_ ich gestehn, da_ ich nicht wei_,
Wohin ich meinen Argwohn richten soll.
Sind's die Gefangnen, die auf ihre Flucht
Verstohlen sinnen?  Ist's die Priesterin,
Die ihnen hilft?  Es mehrt sich das Ger|cht:
Das Schiff, das diese beiden hergebracht,
Sei irgend noch in einer Bucht versteckt.
Und jenes Mannes Wahnsinn, diese Weihe,
Der heil'ge Vorwand dieser Zvgrung, rufen
Den Argwohn lauter und die Vorsicht auf.

Thoas.
Es komme schnell die Priesterin herbei!
Dann geht, durchsucht das Ufer scharf und schnell

And from Edupage, etc. [Now two Newsletters, I will create
a new blurb for each of them. . .Michael]

PAPER GOES ELECTRIC
Researchers at Xerox and at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology have recently developed electronic ink and electronic
paper, which some analysts say may make traditional paper
obsolete.  Electronic paper is easier on the eyes than a computer
screen because it has a higher contrast, and it can display
millions of different images in the same space.  For example,
analysts say that a paper newspaper could easily fit onto
electronic paper, and information could be changed every morning
by deleting yesterday's news and downloading the current news
with no loss of print quality.  Some former MIT students have
already created a company called E Ink, which has developed
electronic ink and paper products and is testing the prototypes
commercially.  The company recently hung an electronic sign in a
Boston department store, where the display is controlled by a
computer from within the store's main office.  These electronic
posters can have text changed instantaneously.
(New Scientist 05/15/99)


DISPUTES AND UNKNOWNS OF ELECTRONIC RIGHTS ROIL THE BOOK INDUSTRY
For all the hype surrounding electronic books, the fast-moving
industry is having trouble convincing the slow-moving book
industry to get on board.  The Authors' Guild mailed warnings to
its 7,500 members last month criticizing current e-book contracts
as bad deals, saying the distribution fees for e-book
manufacturers are payment schemes that would deny publishers and
authors their rewards in the information age.  Other literary
guilds are also advising authors to stay away from e-book
agreements unless they promise to revise the deals when e-books
become more popular. The book industry says it wants to see the
market grow, but wants the terms to be fair.  Current e-book
deals give authors a share of just 4 percent of the book's list
price, compared to 15 percent for traditional book deals.
(New York Times 05/10/99)

COURT SAYS TEMPS DESERVE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
A federal court of appeals has ruled that about 10,000 temporary workers at
Microsoft are entitled to take part in the discounted stock-option plan the
company offers to regular employees. Industry analyst Rob Enderle says,
"This is a broad decision, and it applies to all businesses.  If you've got
a temp worker putting in 20-plus hours a week, you better start considering
him or her like you would a part-time worker" -- and provide employee
benefits.  The ruling indicated that a temporary worker can be considered a
"common-law employee" if the person's work was controlled not by the
placement agency but by the company for which the work was being done.
Microsoft plans to appeal.  (New York Times 14 May 99)

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WANTS ISPs TO SPY
The European Parliament last Friday passed the Lawful Interception of
Communications council resolution on new technologies -- known as Enfopol --
which requires Internet service providers and telephone companies to provide
law-enforcement agencies with full-time, real-time access to Internet
transmissions, even those traversing along multiple networks.  In addition,
wireless communications providers are required to provide geographical
location information on cell phone users, along with decoding of messages,
if encryption is provided as part of the service.  The European Internet
Service Providers' Association has denounced the resolution.  "Anyone who's
got half a clue about the Internet can easily see the Enfopol proposals are
unfeasible," says the chairman of U.K. ISP Linx. "The problem is it's a
bunch of law-enforcement people who have cooked this up in a vacuum without
public consultation."  He also expressed concerns that the stringent
requirements would prompt Internet users from other countries to route
around Europe, damaging the European telecom industry's revenue.  (TechWeb

PRIVACY PROPOSAL
A Clinton Administration proposal to protect individual financial and
medical records includes a request for more than $5 million to fund an
increase in online surveillance and to train law enforcement officials in
ways to combat security fraud. Congressman Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) explained
the problem to his colleagues by writing:  "Do you believe your banking
transaction experiences are private?  You may be surprised to learn that
with certain exceptions, financial institutions may legally share all of
the information about you and your bank account activity with affiliated
businesses or even third parties." (Washington Post  4 May 99)

PC SALES UP, PROFITS DOWN
Unit sales of PCs rose 21% in April, but revenue declined 2.2% as prices
fell and sales of low-cost PCs surged.  The average sales price of a PC was
$928, according to PC Data Corp.  Sales of sub-$1,000 computers accounted
for 71% of all retail sales.  (Bloomberg News/Los Angeles Times 20 May 99)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]

*

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are now three Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers are two
of them, and the third is for announcments for the general public. 
Those of you who want the highest "signal to noise ratio, i.e. the
fewest number of messages containing the most information may want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" lists; just 
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]--
In addition we have opened an "unmoderated list" called "gutvol-d"
to which anyone may subscribe and post messages. . .we may have to
limit subscriptions to actual volunteers if we start getting spam,
but for now this will be a wide open list.

Rememmber:
"gutnberg" = General Public Announcements
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements
"gutvol-d" = Free For All Discussion
 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-l Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-d Your True Name
So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.
