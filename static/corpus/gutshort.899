Would anyone like to work on Romanian Etexts?

We need someone to unRTF a small file.
/home1/36/hart/TARASCON.TEX  I will give you the password.

My idea is to translate into Etext Henryk Sienkiewcz's books. He was 1905
Nobel laureat in literature. Is there anybody who can check my work
(remember - it's in polish!!!) after scanning/correcting?

New Files

We have a very interesting collection of Etext for you this August.

First, two new languages are introduced, Swedish and Danish, and an
introduction to Etext from Project Runeberg, the very first Project
Project Gutenberg spin-off, which started 7 years ago.  Why did the
introduction take so long, as with the Gutenberg Projekt-DE [we are
also going to introduce you to them] many Etext projects wanted the
opportunity to make it on their own. . .which we were glad to have,
until things had gotten strongly underway.  So we decided to wait a
while, at least until our own Project Gutenberg effort had made the
leap to one or two thousand Etexts of our own.  So, now, in efforts
to create a wider availability of languages on the Internet, we are
cooperating with Project Runeberg, the Gutenberg Projekt-DE and the
other Etext operations working in the public domain, to bring wider
language selections to a wider audience around the world.  I didn't
realize that it was not obvious that downloading from European site
locations was very difficult for persons in South Africa, and South
America, Australia, New Zealand, etc. . .or I would have made a big
effort to make this more obvious to everyone sooner.  This fact was
a big part in securing the cooperation of the other projects, along
with the fact that we are happy give full credit, list URLs and all
other contact information for those who create these Etexts.  We do
not have this information for the Danish Bible, if you can help....

[Yes, there is a double negative three sentences up. . .mh]

In addition to Swedish and Danish, we are also continuing with some
German Etexts, including those from our own volunteers. . .Goethe's
Egmont is available this month, and hopefully at least one Etext in
German each month to come, perhaps two. . .one of our own, plus one
from Projekt Gutenberg-DE.

We also continue our series of Human Genome Project chromosomes, to
include 6 more. . .for a total of 12 of the 24 human chromosomes; I
should add that we have chosen the shortest of the 24 files, to get
things going as easily as possible.  The last one is 50 megabytes!!
And these only add up to about 11% of the whole thing, so if you do
want these, the total will eventually be 3.3G.

In addition, we have two more volumes of our Friedrich series; that
now brings our total to 10 of the 21 volumes by Carlyle.

To bring the introduction to a close, we have Thomas More's Utopia,
along with a few dozen other Etexts you will see listed below.

Due to the way we have indexed these for future convenience, we are
including [all from the year 2000] 6 Etexts from June, 25 of April,
and 12 from March. . .yes, we usually do post a few more than 36 as
the Newsletter comes out on the first Wednesday of the month, so we
have a few days of work from the next month, which I feel we should
include, rather than make you wait an additional month.

I should add a few comments about using http ["The Web"] versus ftp
["The Net"]. . .if you use http, then you have to wait for a "human
being" to index the files for that Web Site. . .unless they have an
automated indexing system, which is usually not the case. . .but if
you use ftp [which you can now do from most Web Browsers, you don't
have to wait for such an index to be built.  However, these indices
are often very valuable in searching for what you want, so I should
strongly recommend you use them when, other then when searching for
the very latest Etexts. . .the indices usually contain everything I
have posted, other than from the most recent Newsletter.  If you do
want to use ftp, keep this Newsletter's contents on file so you can
recognize which filenames you want to get.

AOL TO MICROSOFT:  SORRY, BUT IT'S A PRIVATE PARTY
America Online is trying to block attempts by Microsoft's new MSN Messenger
Service to let Microsoft customers exchange messages instantly with AOL's
community of users. Charging  Microsoft with trespassing on its system, AOL
has erected several software barriers to Microsoft's efforts, prompting
Microsoft to respond to each obstruction by developing an immediate
software workaround.  Forrester Research analyst Tom Rhinelander sees the
argument as "kind of like a food fight, like a couple of juveniles saying
'You can't do this,' 'Yes I can,' 'You can't do this,' 'Yes I can.' ...
AOL will say 'we've got to be careful about security and scalability,' and
all these kinds of things.  But they'll be forced to open up to the other
folks, there's no way around it."  (San Jose Mercury News 27 Jul 99)

INTERNET FEVER SPREADS TO BRITAIN
With British ISP Freeserve PLC enjoying a 37% stock price increase on the
first day of public trading, Britain.is getting its first experience of the
wild Internet success stories now common in the U.S.  Freeserve, which is
now the largest access provider in Britain, developed a business model that
gives customers free access -- and derives its revenue exclusively by
taking a share of phone revenue generated by the cost of the telephone
calls users place to Freeserve.   Unlike the U.S., where phone customers in
most parts of the country can make unlimited local calls for a flat monthly
charge, European phone companies (at least for the present!) charge by
minutes of connect time.  (New York Times 27 Jul 99)

RUSSIAN ISP SAYS "NYET" TO SPYING
Russian Internet service provider Bayard-Slavia is refusing to obey a
directive that gives the country's Federal Security Service (FSB) the right
to examine private e-mail messages without a warrant.  The System of
Efficient Research Measures 2directive also requires ISPs to pay for
surveillance equipment in their servers and for a link to FSB headquarters.
In retaliation for Bayard-Slavia's recalcitrance, the FSB has withdrawn the
ISP's license, frozen its bank account, and is challenging its right to
frequencies for its satellite link to Moscow.  "We will never help the FSB
implement illegal shadowing," says Bayard-Slavia's director general.  "We're
the first ISP to struggle against illegal information collection.
Unfortunately, we're also likely to become the first to be destroyed because
of insubordination."  (Data Communications 26 Jul 99)

INTERNET RIVALS ATTEMPT TO OPEN UP AOL'S INSTANT MESSAGE SYSTEM
A number of Internet service providers aim to establish open
access to America Online's exclusive instant messaging programs.
Instant messaging notifies users when their friends are online
and allows them to type messages to each other.  It is an
increasingly popular form of communication, and with three
services and a total 80 million users, AOL dominates the market.
Yet Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Prodigy each attempted to change this
recently by creating rival services that can communicate with
users of AOL's services.  AOL responded to this threat by
changing its communications protocols, effectively eliminating
the rival programs' access to its service.  While Microsoft has
been able to adjust its software to access AOL, Yahoo! and
Prodigy have not.  The three contend that AOL should open its
technology to facilitate interaction between users of all
services.  Yet AOL argues that because access to its services
was unauthorized, the rival services have breached accepted
security standards.  (Wall Street Journal 07/26/99)
