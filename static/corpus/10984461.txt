 such collaborations     important   understand   informaticians can play two general types   informatics roles specifically providing informatics support   bioscience research   performing informatics research   uses   bioscience domain     context   addressing basic informatics research issues     regard     important   point out   bioscientists typically have motivations     very different   those     clinician collaborators   whom many health informaticians have worked     past clinician collaborators   typically primarily involved   clinical practice     looking   additional interesting research projects       can become involved   such collaborators embarking     clinical informatics research project allows them   provide their clinical expertise   participate   sophisticated research   relates   their field     research results   additional visibility   publications   have reason     happy bioscientist collaborators may have   very different motivation     already doing research     looking   informaticians   provide tools   help them perform their research   effectively     typically   looking   additional areas   research peripheral   their field nor

serving   domain experts   informatics research projects even     projects     their field   want help solving their immediate research problems     result bioscientists typically want informaticians   provide them   informatics support conversely academic informaticians want   some level     performing informatics research although     certainly willing   provide informatics support     leads
