12202605.txt 3 canine monocytic ehrlichiosis caused   ticktransmitted ehrlichia canis has been reported     united states   throughout most     world causing extensive morbidity   mortality  clinical   hematologic abnormalities   often nonspecific during e canis infections   coinfections   other ticktransmitted agents such   e chaffeensis may   common  thus   definitive diagnosis may   difficult   make   indirect fluorescentantibody assay ifa     method most widely used   diagnose e canis infection     considered   gold standard  however   can only   performed   specialized laboratories reading
