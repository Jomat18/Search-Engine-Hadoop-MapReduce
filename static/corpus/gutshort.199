This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter of Wednesday, January 6, 1999
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy


As you may recall from past years, we usually do not send this out the
first Wednesday of the year, so it won't get lost in your mailbox when
you return from the holidays, but this year is just going to be so hot
with potential that I thought we should get a head start.

More about all of the 1999 project and deadlines shortly.

Right now we just need to get more xeroxes in from pre-1923 editions,
so we can get your copyright research done.


We have more interest than ever in getting all languages on line; this
will take an ENORMOUS effort, and we will need some very energetic and
patient volunteers to coordinate these efforts.  We would like to find
at least two or three volunteers willing to be Team Leader for various
language teams we will be forming. . .this is going to take some work!

We will be notifying all those who volunteered to work on Spanish. . !


Here are some examples of other interests:

From:  Leonidas Hatzinikolaou <leonidas@hatzinikolaou.org>
I write to you, Michael, with the following proposal: I'm volunteering
to undertake the task of coordinating a collective effort in my country
to digitally publish Greek books in the public domain, both in the Greek
language and translations of them (wherever they can be found) in
English, under the auspices of the GUTENBERG PROJECT. The formats and
all rules of submissions of the e-texts will be according to the rules
established by the GUTENBERG PROJECT. I will try to spread the message
all over Greece asking for more volunteers to help in our task. I will
check-out the texts, their copyright status, etc. Currently I have a web
site under development (http://www.hatzinikolaou.org), where I can host
the Greek e-texts (which require Greek fonts, etc.), which, of course, I
will forward as soon as I receive them to the GUTENBERG PROJECT.

and. . .

Can we work on a few pieces of art, or more music?

Is it possible to, for example, generate a nice
image of the Mona Lisa?  Or a few more MIDI files
of the great classics?  Maybe some of DaVinci's neat
graphics.

It's not text, but would be nice to spice things
up.  What I don't know about are the copyright problems
for art and how to get a high-rez image....I could
visit France and take my own photos...

For suggested books (I'm not volunteering, but in
case you want ideas to pass on);
        Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand
Russell. (1910)
also    Newton's Principia (don't know how old an English translation we can
find...

****

And. . .a piece of good news for you who buying new computers:

Current PC sales at the end of 1998:

$1,000 is the current average price--
$800 - $1200 accounts for 67% of all:
1 computer out of 6 costs over $1200:
1 computer out of 6 costs under $800.

***

And now here are the usual 36 Etexts we provide in each Newsletter. . . .

28 are officially for release in August, 1999, and 8 or 9 more in
June, 1999. . .you MAY want to replace the listing we sent to you
for June two months ago, as it will be easier than pasting in.

LIBRARY REMOVES SOFTWARE FILTERS
Responding to a federal court's ruling that the Loudoun County (VA.)
library's use of software filters to screen out sexually explicit material
on the Internet was unconstitutional (Edupage 24 Nov 98), the Library Board
has removed filters from some of its computers and left them on others;
adults will decide whether they want to use a computer with a filter or one
without, and parents of minors will be asked to sign a statement specifying
whether or not they want their child to have unfiltered Internet access.
Library patron Becky Montcastle-Jones urged the library board to appeal the
court's ruling, saying:  "We have not had pornographic or salacious material
in our library.  Why, just because we have new technology to get to it very
quickly, should we have any different policy?  In the video section, you
can't go in there and get a pornographic movie.  Librarians throughout
history have had to make choices about what will be in the library.  That's
not censorship -- that's choice."  But board member Marc Leepson expressed
the view of 6 out of the 8 board members:  "I'm completely comfortable with
the new policy.  It's constitutional, and it still protects children."
(Washington Post 3 Dec 98)

NBC ACQUIRES PART OF "WOMEN'S CONTENT" SITE
Noting that women "happen to be the fastest-growing element on the
Internet," an executive of the NBC television network has announced it will
promote the iVillage Internet service, which he described as "the leading
women's content site."  NBC, in turn, will receive an ownership stake in
that service, which now also provides information about parenting, families
and health for special sites on Snap -- an ad-supported Web site owned by
NBC and C/NET.  (USA Today 30 Nov 98)

NADER GROUP CHALLENGES AOL-NETSCAPE MERGER
Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Project, a group run by long-time consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, says it will vigorously oppose the merger between
America Online and Netscape.  "We feel this will harm competition in the ISP
market," says director James Love.  "ISPs will have to go to Netscape or
Microsoft for browser software.  They compete against both and if they have
to go to them to get software, it creates all kinds of problems."  Love says
his group plans to ask the Justice Department or the Federal Trade
Commission to nix the merger.  "We don't care if Netscape sells its company
to anybody else but AOL or Microsoft."  (TechWeb 25 Nov 98)

DOD FALSIFIED Y2K DATA BUT HAS "GOOD FEELING" ABOUT FUTURE
A Department of Defense inspector-general report says that the Defense
Special Weapons Agency never conducted required tests on three of five
"mission critical" computer systems it had certified as Y2K-compliant.  The
military officer assigned to correct the agency's Year 2000 problems says he
agrees with the report but that the systems in question will be "100% in
compliance" by April 1999:  "I have a good feeling about Y2K in this
agency."  (USA Today 27-29 Nov 98)
