This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter, for Wednesday, April 7, 1999
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

This month we have Etexts in English, French and Japanese as well as a
few translations into English from the French, German and Greek.  I am
hopeful we can continue even more in a wide variety of languages.

Several new Project Gutenberg sites listed below and more than a whole
month's worth of new Etexts. . .we finished all of November in March--
so we are 8 months ahead of schedule, instead of our usual 1 month.  I
hope we can finish all the December Etexts in the next 28 days. . . .


Lots of things in this Newsletter, not the least of which is that this
month the Newsletter goes out on the last possible day since the first
Wednesday is April 7th, which will gave us a very long month to get up
to completing the November Etexts, but will leave us with less time to
do the December Etexts, a time that is already overloaded with these:

1.  Every April and October we request new volunteers, before everyone
    leaves for the summer, and when they are firmly back in the fall.

2.  This year we are creating a support system for new our volunteers,
    which will be thoroughly tested this month.  This is a BIG project
    and will take some effort to complete.  If you would be willing to
    help some of our new volunteers get started, please let me know.
    [more below on this, probably the most important thing right now]

3.  We are releasing our first Etext without ASCII characters, and the
    hopes are we will be able to interest many of you in looking at an
    Etext of Rashomon, in Japanese, as well as in translation.  So far
    the translation is not yet complete, but we are working on it.  In
    Japanese, it is the first file in the list below.

4.  We are gearing up for our first official public relations effort--
    if you can help us get some extra media coverage for Etext #2000--
    that would be GREATLY APPRECIATED. . .now is the time to start and
    we will continue right through the official release date of #2000.

5.  We will probably have to get incorporated in the year 2000, so the
    lawyers who can help us with that will also be very appreciated.

6.  The Visually Impaired Team of Project Gutenberg Volunteers:
    Jay Mendham <jmendham@interlog.com>, temporary Team Leader.
    This is a team of visually impaired volunteers who create a
    set of general Etexts for the Project Gutenberg audience.

7.  The next Project Gutenberg message you are likely to receive
    will be a request for volunteers and donations. . .if you do
    not want to read it, feel free to just delete it. . . .  The
    Volunteers' List will receive one more message beforehand.


From:  webmaster@promo.net [Pietro di Miceli]
There is a new PG Volunteers' Board available at:
http://promo.net/pg/vol/wwwboard/
Please use and peruse it and send me any suggestions,
corrections, etc.
Also see:  http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html


8.  We are still VERY interested in doing more languages, if you
    can do even ONE Etext, however short, in various languages--
    this would be more appreciated than you can imagine.

Requests:

For May 16, 1999  [Please forward this to Balzac interests. . . .]

In honor of the bicentennial of the birth of Honore de Balzac (1799 -
- 1850) Project Gutenberg is proud to present English translations of the
entire "Human Comedy." Portraying over two thousand characters and with
immense attention to detail, this massive collection of just under one
hundred novels and shorter works brings to life the social history of France
during the first half of the 19th century.

Team Balzac is seeking a qualifying biography of Honore de Balzac and any
non-Human Comedy works. Except for The Human Comedy and Droll Tales we have
been unable to locate any qualifying editions. If anyone is able to assist,
please email Dagny at dagnyj@hotmail.com

*

From: Michael Pullen <globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com>

Request for assistance/information: Gothic German typeface

I use a scanner to enter raw manuscript material and a software
package for interpreting into e-text. While the software (Visioneer
ProOCR 100) offers a decent German dictionary for spell checking, it
does not recognize the old German scripts called Fraktur. This
moderately ornate and stylized font has gone out of style since 1945,
but many of the older German originals are available ONLY in this
mode. Examples of this style can be viewed on the Internet at the web
site http://www.waldenfont.com/gutenberg2 and many others (use the
word fraktur with your favorite web search engine).

Do you know of, or can suggest, any means of scanning/parsing this
older typeface? If you have any information, please contact the
Gutenberg Project office or myself (globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com).
Your assistance will be greatly appreciated in accelerating several
projects.

*

If you can get a pre-1923 copy of Swiss Family Robinson,
AnneWing@aol.com would either like to borrow it or have
you do some proofing of an Etext she has. . .thanks. mh

*

I have my own personal request. . .someone good with FTP
to help me post books when I am away from my desk.    mh

*

Don Quixote
If anyone is a student at Boston University, their library
system has a 1910-1913 and a 1922-1923 edition which
apparently are circulating, so that would be even better.

*

We need a copy of this because we made an Etext,
then lost contact with the person we sent it to.
Actually we don't really need to HAVE the copy,
if you are willing to do some proofreading.
The Jewel of Seven Stars, by Bram Stoker
Please contact [and cc: hart@pobox.com]:
Aaron Cannon <cannona@fireantproductions.com>

Notes:

You probably already know about this, but I have found Ebay to be a good
source of books older than 1921. I did a search in the book category for
1921 (in titles and descriptions) and found quite a number of books with
a copyright of 1921 (some even with a scan of the copyright page) So you
might suggest to volunteers looking for a cheap book to contribute to
look at http://www.ebay.com

About our Webster's Unabridged Dictionary

Some people thought the filenames would be

pgws05*.txt and .zip

however. . .in this case the volunteer added an extra 0, I know not why,
and the location of the number part changed, so the files you want are:

pgw050xz.txt
pgw050tw.txt
pgw050s.txt
pgw050r.txt
pgw050pq.txt
pgw050mo.txt
pgw050il.txt
pgw050fh.txt
pgw050de.txt
pgw050c.txt
pgw050ab.txt
and
readme.web

Sorry for the confusion, will add to next newsletter. . . .

Newer versions just add one. . .next will be 060. . . .

But most start with versions 10, 11, 12, etc.
Only those we know will be "in progress" for
some time before they are up to our standard,
but are too important not to post immediately
get numbers lower than 10, as an indicator of
"not yet ready for prime time."

Not Just Intel and the Pentium III


From Edupage:

MICROSOFT RESPONDS TO PRIVACY ISSUE
Reacting to a controversy started when a programmer in Brookline, Mass.,
discovered Windows 98 generates a unique serial number that is implanted in
every electronic document and that can be used to trace the identity of its
author, Microsoft said it will create a software tool to allow customers to
remove the number, which was created to help support specialists diagnose
problems for customers who call with questions.  Jason Catlett, who lobbies
on privacy issues, says, "This is going to be a cleanup job larger than the
Exxon Valdez oil spill.  There are billions of tattooed documents out
there."  (AP 8 Mar 99)

IBM ACTION ENCOURAGES WEB SITES TO POST CLEAR PRIVACY POLICIES
IBM, which is the second-biggest advertiser on the Internet, has decided to
refrain from advertising on any Web sites that do not post clear policies
explaining to visitors of those sites such things as what information about
them is being collected and how it will be used, sold, or otherwise
disseminated for marketing purposes.  IBM is the first large company to
link advertising and privacy policy in this way.  (Wall Street Journal 31
Mar 99)

Edupage ... is what you've just finished reading excerpts of--
to subscribe to Edupage: send mail to: listproc@educom.unc.edu
with the message:           subscribe edupage Susan B. Anthony
(if your name is Susan B. Anthony; otherwise use your own name
To unsubscribe send a message to:      listproc@educom.unc.edu
with the message: unsubscribe edupage.   If you have problems,
send email to manager@educom.unc.edu.)   "I love Edupage."  mh

Edupage is supported by Educom

and from several of our people:

Some, if not most, VCR's won't be able to use the programmed advanced
recording feature.  Do not throw away your VCR in the year 2000.  Set
the year on 1972 because the calendar days of the week and month will
be the same as the year 2000.  Please pass this on because it is very
unlikely the manufacturers will not share this information.  They may
want you to buy a new one that is Y2K compliant.


Next month, Etext #2000. . .I hope!!!


You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks!!
