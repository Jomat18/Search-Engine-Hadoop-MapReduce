*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for *Wednesday, May 5, 1999*
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

Well, we managed to finish the 1999 Etexts 8 months ahead of schedule,
though it has been a struggle to do 36 Etexts each month of 1999 after
doing 72 a month for the last half of 1998.  This is somewhat replying
to those who have asked why don't we make a more difficult schedule in
the year 2000. . .right now there is no way we could be doing more for
each month than we are. . .we are barely getting the 36 Etexts done in
time for the Newsletter each month, which often gives us a few days of
extra time, which we are glad to take advantage of.

We hope you will take the opportunity to volunteer to do your favorite
book[s] from before 1923, and to look over our new volunteers' site at
promo.net, which should make volunteering much more effortless.  Also,
you can email me and the other Project Gutenberg Directors listed. . .

***Announcement***

May 16, 1799

In honor of the bicentennial of the birth of Honore de Balzac (1799 -
- 1850) Project Gutenberg is proud to present English translations of the
entire "Human Comedy." Portraying over two thousand characters and with
immense attention to detail, this massive collection of just under one
hundred novels and shorter works brings to life the social history of France
during the first half of the 19th century.

Team Balzac is seeking a qualifying biography of Honore de Balzac and any
non-Human Comedy works. Except for The Human Comedy and Droll Tales we have
been unable to locate any qualifying editions. If anyone is able to assist,
please email Dagny at dagnyj@hotmail.com

***Requests***

We have had many requests for Henrik Ibsen, and done
the copyright research for several editions, but we
have never completed any. . .anyone interested??

We are interested in finding out if there are people at the University of
Texas at Austin and the Harry Ransom Center who are currently involved in the
Gutenberg Project, or thinking of making a contribution to it. Our specific
interest would be in French and Italian texts and public domain English
translations of these texts. To discuss possibilities, please email me at:

>You probably already know about this, but I have found Ebay to be a good
>source of books older than 1921. . . .

Yes indeed, but for most books I think http://www.abebooks.com/ is a better
bet.  It's certainly a lot simpler than all the auction nonsense, tho'
perhaps not as much fun. . . .

**** And here are the books to finish out the year 1999, and start 2000 *****
