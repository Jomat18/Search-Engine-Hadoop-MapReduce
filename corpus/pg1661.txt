doubt suggested clay s ingenious mind colour
accomplice s hair pounds week lure draw
playing thousands
advertisement rogue temporary
office rogue incites man apply
manage secure absence morning
week time i heard assistant having come
half wages obvious strong motive
securing situation
but guess motive

extreme limits result confessed
fascinating artistic
certain selection discretion used producing
realistic effect remarked holmes wanting

morning train care good aunt harrow
slow process official inquiry came
conclusion doctor met fate indiscreetly
playing dangerous pet little i learn
case told sherlock holmes travelled

notice mr hatherley s thumb colonel
warburton s madness afforded
finer field acute original observer but
strange inception dramatic details
worthy placed record
gave friend fewer openings deductive methods
reasoning achieved remarkable results story
i believe told newspapers but
like narratives effect striking
set forth en bloc single half column print
facts slowly evolve eyes mystery clears
gradually away new discovery furnishes step leads
complete truth time circumstances
deep impression lapse years hardly
served weaken effect

went upstairs colonel lamp
fat manager i labyrinth old house
corridors passages narrow winding staircases little
low doors thresholds hollowed
generations crossed carpets
signs furniture ground floor plaster
peeling walls damp breaking
green unhealthy blotches i tried unconcerned
air possible but i forgotten warnings

companions ferguson appeared morose silent
man but i little said
fellow countryman
colonel lysander stark stopped low door
unlocked small square room
hardly time ferguson remained outside
colonel ushered
said actually hydraulic press
particularly unpleasant thing
turn ceiling small chamber really
end descending piston comes force
tons metal floor small lateral columns
water outside receive force transmit
multiply manner familiar machine
goes readily but stiffness working
lost little force
goodness look set
right
i took lamp i examined machine
thoroughly gigantic capable
exercising enormous pressure i passed outside
pressed levers controlled i knew
whishing sound slight leakage allowed
regurgitation water cylinders
examination showed india rubber bands
round head driving rod shrunk quite
socket worked clearly cause
loss power i pointed companions
followed remarks carefully asked practical
questions proceed set right i
clear i returned main chamber
machine took good look satisfy curiosity
obvious glance story fuller s earth
merest fabrication absurd suppose
powerful engine designed inadequate
purpose walls wood but floor consisted
large iron trough i came examine i
crust metallic deposit i stooped
scraping exactly i heard
muttered exclamation german saw cadaverous face
colonel looking
asked
i felt angry having tricked elaborate story
told i admiring fuller s earth
said i i think i better able advise
machine i knew exact purpose
used
instant i uttered words i regretted rashness
speech face set hard baleful light sprang
grey eyes
said shall know machine
took step backward slammed little door turned key
lock i rushed pulled handle but
quite secure kicks
shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let
suddenly silence i heard sound sent
heart mouth clank levers swish
leaking cylinder set engine work lamp

trough light i saw black ceiling coming
slowly jerkily but knew better
force minute grind
shapeless pulp i threw screaming door
dragged nails lock i implored colonel let
but remorseless clanking levers drowned
cries ceiling foot head
hand upraised i feel hard rough surface
flashed mind pain death depend
position i met i lay
face weight come spine i shuddered
think dreadful snap easier way
i nerve lie look deadly black
shadow wavering i unable stand
erect eye caught brought gush hope
heart
i said floor ceiling iron
walls wood i gave hurried glance i saw
line yellow light boards
broadened broadened small panel pushed backward
instant i hardly believe door
led away death instant i threw
lay half fainting panel
closed but crash lamp
moments clang slabs metal told
narrow escape
i recalled frantic plucking wrist
i found lying stone floor narrow corridor
woman bent tugged left hand
held candle right good friend
warning i foolishly rejected
come come cried breathlessly
moment oh waste
precious time but come
time i scorn advice i staggered
feet ran corridor winding
stair led broad passage
reached heard sound running feet shouting
voices answering floor
beneath guide stopped looked
like wit s end threw open door

shining brightly
chance said high but
jump
spoke light sprang view end
passage i saw lean figure colonel lysander stark
rushing forward lantern hand weapon like
butcher s cleaver i rushed bedroom
flung open window looked quiet sweet
wholesome garden looked moonlight
thirty feet i clambered sill but i
hesitated jump i heard passed
saviour ruffian pursued ill used
risks i determined assistance
thought hardly flashed mind
door pushing way past but threw arms round
tried hold
fritz fritz cried english remember promise
time said
silent oh silent
mad elise shouted struggling break away
ruin seen let
pass i say dashed rushing
window cut heavy weapon i let
hanging hands sill blow fell i
conscious dull pain grip loosened i fell
garden
i shaken but hurt fall i picked
rushed bushes hard i run i
understood i far danger suddenly
i ran deadly dizziness sickness came
i glanced hand throbbing painfully
time saw thumb cut
blood pouring wound i endeavoured tie
handkerchief round but came sudden buzzing
ears moment i fell dead faint
