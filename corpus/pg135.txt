supreme hour began recite love verses
verses
vous rappelez vous notre douce vie
lorsque nous etions si jeunes tous deux
et que nous n avions au coeur d autre envie
que d etre bien mis et d etre amoureux
lorsqu en ajoutant votre age mon age
nous ne comptions pas deux quarante ans
et que dans notre humble et petit menage
tout meme l hiver nous etait printemps
beaux jours manuel etait fier et sage
paris s asseyait saints banquets
foy lancait la foudre et votre corsage
avait une epingle ou je piquais
tout vous contemplait avocat sans causes
quand je vous menais au prado diner
vous etiez jolie au point que les roses
faisaient l effet se retourner
je les entendais dire est elle belle
comme elle sent bon quels cheveux flots
sous son mantelet elle cache une aile
son bonnet charmant est peine eclos
j errais avec toi pressant ton bras souple
les passants crovaient que l amour charme
avait marie dans notre heureux couple
le doux mois d avril au beau mois mai
nous vivions caches contents porte close
devorant l amour bon fruit defendu
ma bouche n avait pas dit une chose
que deja ton coeur avait repondu
la sorbonne etait l endroit bucolique
ou je t adorais du soir au matin
c est ainsi qu une ame amoureuse applique
la carte du tendre au pays latin
o place maubert o place dauphine
quand dans le taudis frais et printanier
tu tirais ton bas sur ton jambe fine
je voyais astre au fond du grenier
j ai fort lu platon mais rien ne m en reste
mieux que malebranche et que lamennais
tu demontrais la bonte celeste
avec une fleur que tu donnais
je t obeissais tu m etais soumise
o grenier dore te lacer te voir
aller et venir des l aube en chemise
mirant ton jeune ton vieux miroir
et qui pourrait perde la memoire
ces temps d aurore et firmament
rubans fleurs gaze et moire
ou l amour begaye argot charmant
nos jardins etaient pot tulipe
tu masquais la vitre avec jupon
je prenais le bol terre pipe
et je te donnais le tasse en japon
et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire
ton manchon brule ton boa perdu
et ce cher portrait du divin shakespeare
qu soir pour souper nons avons vendu
j etais mendiant et toi charitable
je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds
dante folio nous servait table
pour manger gaiment cent marrons
la premiere fois qu en mon joyeux bouge
je pris baiser ton levre en feu
quand tu t en allais decoiffee et rouge
je restai tout pale et je crus en dieu
te rappelles tu nos bonheurs sans nombre
et tous ces fichus changes en chiffons
oh que soupirs nos coeurs pleins d ombre
se sont envoles dans les cieux profonds
