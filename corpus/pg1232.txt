chapter ii concerning hereditary principalities
i leave discussion republics inasmuch
place i written length address
principalities i order indicated
discuss principalities ruled preserved
i say fewer difficulties holding hereditary states
long accustomed family prince new
ones sufficient transgress customs
ancestors deal prudently circumstances arise
prince average powers maintain state unless
deprived extraordinary excessive force
deprived sinister happens
usurper regain
italy example duke ferrara
withstood attacks venetians pope julius
unless long established dominions
hereditary prince cause necessity offend
happens loved unless extraordinary vices cause
hated reasonable expect subjects
naturally disposed antiquity duration
rule memories motives make change lost
change leaves toothing
chapter iii concerning mixed principalities
but difficulties occur new principality firstly
entirely new but member state taken
collectively called composite changes arise chiefly
inherent difficulty new principalities
men change rulers willingly hoping better
hope induces arms rules
deceived find experience
gone bad worse follows natural common
necessity causes new prince burden
submitted soldiery infinite hardships
new acquisition
way enemies injured
seizing principality able friends
able satisfy
way expected strong measures
feeling bound strong armed
forces entering province need goodwill
natives
reasons louis twelfth king france quickly occupied
milan quickly lost turn time
needed lodovico s forces opened
gates finding deceived hopes future
benefit endure ill treatment new prince
true acquiring rebellious provinces second time
lightly lost prince
little reluctance takes opportunity rebellion punish
delinquents clear suspects strengthen
weakest places cause france lose milan time
duke lodovico raise insurrections borders
but cause lose second time necessary bring
world armies defeated
driven italy followed causes mentioned
duke lodovico lodovico moro son francesco
sforza married beatrice d este ruled milan
died
milan taken france second
time general reasons discussed remains
second resources
situation maintaining
securely acquisition king france
i say dominions acquired added
ancient state acquires country
language easier hold
especially accustomed self government
hold securely destroyed family
prince ruling peoples preserving
things old conditions unlike customs live
quietly seen brittany burgundy gascony
normandy bound france long time
difference language
customs alike people easily able
annexed wishes hold
bear mind considerations family
lord extinguished laws
taxes altered short time
entirely body old principality
but states acquired country differing language
customs laws difficulties good fortune great
energy needed hold greatest real
helps acquired reside
make position secure durable
turk greece notwithstanding measures
taken holding state settled
able spot disorders
seen spring quickly remedy but
hand heard great
longer remedy country pillaged
officials subjects satisfied prompt recourse
prince wishing good cause love
wishing fear attack state
outside utmost caution long prince
resides wrested greatest
difficulty
better course send colonies places
keys state necessary
great number cavalry infantry
prince spend colonies little expense
send offends minority
citizens takes lands houses new
inhabitants offends remaining poor scattered
able injure whilst rest uninjured easily
kept quiet time anxious err fear
happen despoiled
conclusion i say colonies costly
faithful injure injured said
poor scattered hurt remark men
ought treated crushed avenge
lighter injuries ones
injury man ought
kind stand fear revenge
but maintaining armed men place colonies spends
having consume garrison income
state acquisition turns loss
exasperated state injured shifting
garrison acquainted hardship
hostile enemies whilst beaten
ground able hurt reason
guards useless colony useful
prince holds country differing respects
ought make head defender powerful
neighbours weaken powerful taking care
foreigner powerful shall accident
footing happen
introduced discontented excess
ambition fear seen romans
brought greece aetolians country
obtained footing brought inhabitants
usual course affairs soon powerful foreigner enters
country subject states drawn moved hatred
feel ruling power respect
subject states trouble gain
quickly rally state
acquired care hold
power authority forces
goodwill easily powerful
remain entirely master country
properly manage business soon lose acquired
whilst hold endless difficulties troubles
romans countries annexed observed closely
measures sent colonies maintained friendly relations
minor powers increasing strength kept
greater allow strong foreign powers gain authority
greece appears sufficient example achaeans
aetolians kept friendly kingdom macedonia
humbled antiochus driven merits achaeans
aetolians secured permission increase power
persuasions philip induce romans friends
humbling influence antiochus make
agree retain lordship country
romans instances prudent princes ought
regard present troubles but future ones
prepare energy foreseen
easy remedy but wait approach medicine
longer time malady incurable
happens physicians say happens hectic fever
beginning malady easy cure but difficult
detect but course time having detected
treated beginning easy detect but difficult
cure happens affairs state evils arise
foreseen given wise man
quickly redressed but having foreseen
permitted grow way
longer remedy romans foreseeing troubles
dealt avoid war let
come head knew war avoided but
advantage wished fight
philip antiochus greece italy
avoided but wish
mouths wise ones
time let enjoy benefits time but benefits
valour prudence time drives
able bring good evil evil good
remark introduction word
intrattenere
but let turn france inquire

opposite things ought retain
state composed divers elements
louis xii king france father people

charles viii king france born died
king louis brought italy ambition venetians
desired obtain half state lombardy intervention i

venetians realize rashness course taken
order secure towns lombardy king
master thirds italy
let consider little difficulty king
maintained position italy observed rules laid
kept friends secure protected
numerous weak timid afraid church
venetians forced
stand means easily
secure remained powerful but sooner
milan contrary assisting pope alexander occupy
romagna occurred action weakening
depriving friends thrown
lap whilst aggrandized church adding
temporal power spiritual giving greater authority
having committed prime error obliged follow
end ambition alexander prevent
master tuscany forced come
italy

left kingdom pensioner king drove
able drive louis turn
wish acquire truth natural common men

louis errors destroyed minor powers
increased strength greater powers italy
brought foreign power settle country
send colonies errors lived injure
sixth taking away dominions
venetians aggrandized church brought spain
italy reasonable necessary humble
but having taken steps ought
consented ruin powerful
kept designs lombardy venetians

chapter iv kingdom darius conquered alexander
rebel successors alexander death
considering difficulties men hold newly

infinite difficulties assisted
crushed exterminated
family prince lords remain make
heads fresh movements unable
satisfy exterminate state lost time brings
opportunity
consider nature government
darius find similar kingdom turk
necessary alexander overthrow

darius killed state remained secure alexander
reasons successors united
enjoyed securely ease tumults raised
kingdom provoked
but impossible hold tranquillity states constituted
like france arose frequent rebellions
romans spain france greece owing principalities
states long memory

chapter vi concerning new principalities acquired s
arms ability

reason i consider prince ought reckon conspiracies
little account people hold esteem but
hostile bears hatred ought fear
everybody ordered states wise princes
taken care drive nobles desperation
people satisfied contented important

king away reproach
liable nobles favouring people people
favouring nobles set arbiter

draw important conclusion princes ought leave affairs
