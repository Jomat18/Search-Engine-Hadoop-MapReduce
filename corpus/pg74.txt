homeless head friendly hand wipe death damps brow
loving face bend pityingly great agony came
looked glad morning
oh drop little tear poor lifeless form
heave little sigh bright young life rudely blighted
untimely cut
window went maid servant s discordant voice profaned holy
calm deluge water drenched prone martyr s remains
strangling hero sprang relieving snort whiz
missile air mingled murmur curse sound

talk ran but presently began flag trifle
grow disjointed silences widened expectoration marvellously
increased pore inside boys cheeks spouting
fountain scarcely bail cellars tongues
fast prevent inundation little overflowings
throats occurred spite sudden retchings
followed time boys looking pale miserable
joe s pipe dropped nerveless fingers tom s followed
fountains going furiously pumps bailing
main joe said feebly

talkative supper night humble look
huck prepared pipe meal going prepare
said feeling ate
dinner disagreed
midnight joe awoke called boys brooding
oppressiveness air bode boys
huddled sought friendly companionship
dull dead heat breathless atmosphere
stifling sat intent waiting solemn hush continued
light swallowed
blackness darkness presently came quivering glow
vaguely revealed foliage moment vanished
came little stronger faint moan came
sighing branches forest boys felt fleeting
breath cheeks shuddered fancy spirit
night gone pause weird flash turned
night day showed little grassblade separate
distinct grew feet showed white
startled faces deep peal thunder went rolling tumbling
heavens lost sullen rumblings distance
sweep chilly air passed rustling leaves snowing
flaky ashes broadcast fierce glare lit
forest instant crash followed rend treetops
right boys heads clung terror thick
gloom followed big raindrops fell pattering leaves
quick boys tent exclaimed tom
sprang away stumbling roots vines dark
plunging direction furious blast roared
trees making sing went blinding flash
came peal peal deafening thunder drenching
rain poured rising hurricane drove sheets
ground boys cried but roaring wind
booming thunderblasts drowned voices utterly
straggled took shelter tent cold scared
streaming water but company misery
grateful talk old sail flapped
furiously noises allowed tempest
rose higher higher presently sail tore loose
fastenings went winging away blast boys seized
hands fled tumblings bruises shelter
great oak stood riverbank battle
highest ceaseless conflagration lightning flamed
skies stood cleancut shadowless
distinctness bending trees billowy river white foam
driving spray spumeflakes dim outlines high bluffs
glimpsed drifting cloudrack slanting
veil rain little giant tree yielded fight
fell crashing younger growth unflagging
thunderpeals came ear splitting explosive bursts keen sharp
unspeakably appalling storm culminated matchless effort
likely tear island pieces burn drown
treetops blow away deafen creature
moment wild night homeless young heads
but battle forces retired weaker
weaker threatenings grumblings peace resumed sway
boys went camp good deal awed but found
thankful great sycamore shelter
beds ruin blasted lightnings
catastrophe happened
camp drenched campfire but
heedless lads like generation provision
rain matter dismay soaked
chilled eloquent distress but presently
discovered eaten far great log
built curved upward separated
ground handbreadth escaped wetting
patiently wrought shreds bark gathered
sides sheltered logs coaxed burn
piled great dead boughs till roaring furnace
gladhearted dried boiled ham feast
sat expanded glorified
midnight adventure morning dry spot sleep
sun began steal boys drowsiness came
went sandbar lay sleep got
scorched drearily set getting breakfast
meal felt rusty stiff jointed little homesick
tom saw signs fell cheering pirates
but cared marbles circus swimming
reminded imposing secret raised ray
cheer lasted got interested new device
knock pirates indians change
attracted idea long
stripped striped head heel black mud like
zebras chiefs course went tearing
woods attack english settlement
separated hostile tribes darted
ambush dreadful warwhoops killed scalped
thousands gory day consequently extremely
satisfactory
assembled camp suppertime hungry happy but
difficulty arose hostile indians break bread
hospitality making peace simple
impossibility smoking pipe peace
process heard savages wished
remained pirates way
cheerfulness muster called pipe
took whiff passed form
behold glad gone savagery
gained found smoke little
having hunt lost knife sick
seriously uncomfortable likely fool away high
promise lack effort practised cautiously supper
right fair success spent jubilant evening
prouder happier new acquirement
scalping skinning nations leave
smoke chatter brag use
