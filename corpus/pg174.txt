chapter
studio filled rich odour roses light
summer wind stirred amidst trees garden came
open door heavy scent lilac delicate
perfume pink flowering thorn
corner divan persian saddle bags
lying smoking custom innumerable cigarettes lord henry
wotton catch gleam honey sweet honey coloured
blossoms laburnum tremulous branches hardly able
bear burden beauty flamelike
fantastic shadows birds flight flitted long
tussore silk curtains stretched huge window
producing kind momentary japanese effect making think
pallid jade faced painters tokyo medium
art necessarily immobile seek convey sense
swiftness motion sullen murmur bees shouldering
way long unmown grass circling monotonous
insistence round dusty gilt horns straggling woodbine
make stillness oppressive dim roar london
like bourdon note distant organ
centre room clamped upright easel stood
length portrait young man extraordinary personal beauty
little distance away sitting artist
basil hallward sudden disappearance years ago
caused time public excitement gave rise

wind shook blossoms trees heavy

languid air grasshopper began chirrup wall like
blue thread long dragon fly floated past brown gauze
wings lord henry felt hear basil hallward s heart
beating wondered coming

says bad influence friends
single exception
dorian gray stepped dais air young greek
martyr little moue discontent lord henry
taken fancy unlike basil
delightful contrast beautiful voice
moments said really bad influence lord
henry bad basil says
thing good influence mr gray influence
immoral immoral scientific point view
influence person s soul
think natural thoughts burn natural passions
virtues real sins things
sins borrowed echo s music
actor written aim life
self development realize s nature perfectly
people afraid nowadays
forgotten highest duties duty owes
s self course charitable feed hungry
clothe beggar but souls starve naked courage
gone race really terror
society basis morals terror god
secret religion things govern
turn head little right dorian like good
boy said painter deep work conscious look
come lad s face seen
continued lord henry low musical voice
graceful wave hand characteristic
eton days i believe man
live life fully completely form
feeling expression thought reality dream i
believe world gain fresh impulse joy
forget maladies mediaevalism return
hellenic ideal finer richer hellenic ideal
but bravest man afraid
mutilation savage tragic survival self denial
mars lives punished refusals impulse
strive strangle broods mind poisons body
sins sin action mode
purification remains but recollection pleasure
luxury regret way rid temptation
yield resist soul grows sick longing
things forbidden desire
monstrous laws monstrous unlawful said
great events world place brain
brain brain great sins world place
mr gray rose red youth
rose white boyhood passions afraid
thoughts filled terror day dreams sleeping
dreams mere memory stain cheek shame
stop faltered dorian gray stop bewilder i don t know
say answer but i find don t
speak let think let try think
nearly minutes stood motionless parted lips
eyes strangely bright dimly conscious entirely fresh
influences work
come really words basil s friend said
words spoken chance doubt wilful paradox
touched secret chord touched
but felt vibrating throbbing curious pulses
music stirred like music troubled times
but music articulate new world but
chaos created words mere words
terrible clear vivid cruel
escape subtle magic
able plastic form formless things
music sweet viol lute mere
words real words
yes things boyhood understood
understood life suddenly fiery coloured
walking
known
subtle smile lord henry watched knew precise
psychological moment say felt intensely
interested amazed sudden impression words
produced remembering book read sixteen
book revealed known
wondered dorian gray passing similar experience
merely shot arrow air hit mark
fascinating lad
hallward painted away marvellous bold touch
true refinement perfect delicacy art rate comes
strength unconscious silence
basil i tired standing cried dorian gray suddenly i
sit garden air stifling
dear fellow i sorry i painting i t think
but sat better perfectly
i caught effect i wanted half parted lips
bright look eyes i don t know harry saying
but certainly wonderful expression
i suppose paying compliments mustn t believe
word says
certainly paying compliments
reason i don t believe told
know believe said lord henry looking
dreamy languorous eyes i garden
horribly hot studio basil let iced
drink strawberries
certainly harry touch bell parker comes i
tell want i got work background i
join later don t dorian long i
better form painting i day going
masterpiece masterpiece stands
lord henry went garden found dorian gray burying
face great cool lilac blossoms feverishly drinking
perfume wine came close hand
shoulder quite right murmured
cure soul but senses cure
senses but soul
lad started drew bareheaded leaves
tossed rebellious curls tangled gilded threads
look fear eyes people
suddenly awakened finely chiselled nostrils quivered
hidden nerve shook scarlet lips left trembling
yes continued lord henry great secrets
life cure soul means senses senses means
soul wonderful creation know
think know know want know
dorian gray frowned turned head away help liking
tall graceful young man standing romantic
olive coloured face worn expression interested
low languid voice absolutely fascinating
cool white flowerlike hands curious charm
moved spoke like music language
but felt afraid ashamed afraid
left stranger reveal known
basil hallward months but friendship
altered suddenly come life
disclosed life s mystery
afraid schoolboy girl
absurd frightened
let sit shade said lord henry parker brought
drinks stay longer glare
quite spoiled basil paint really
allow sunburnt unbecoming
matter cried dorian gray laughing sat
seat end garden
matter mr gray
marvellous youth youth thing
worth having
i don t feel lord henry
don t feel day old wrinkled
ugly thought seared forehead lines
passion branded lips hideous fires feel
feel terribly charm world
wonderfully beautiful face mr
gray don t frown beauty form genius
higher genius needs explanation
great facts world like sunlight spring time
reflection dark waters silver shell call moon
questioned divine right sovereignty
makes princes smile ah lost
won t smile people say beauty
superficial but superficial
thought beauty wonder wonders
shallow people judge appearances true mystery
world visible invisible yes mr gray
gods good but gods quickly
away years live really perfectly
fully youth goes beauty
suddenly discover triumphs left
content mean triumphs memory
past make bitter defeats month wanes
brings nearer dreadful time jealous
wars lilies roses sallow
hollow cheeked dull eyed suffer horribly ah
realize youth don t squander gold
days listening tedious trying improve hopeless failure
giving away life ignorant common vulgar
sickly aims false ideals age live live
wonderful life let lost
searching new sensations afraid new
hedonism century wants visible
symbol personality
world belongs season moment i met i saw
quite unconscious really really
charmed i felt i
tell i thought tragic
wasted little time youth
little time common hill flowers wither but
blossom laburnum yellow june
month purple stars clematis year
year green night leaves hold purple stars but
youth pulse joy beats
sluggish limbs fail senses rot degenerate
hideous puppets haunted memory passions
afraid exquisite temptations
courage yield youth youth absolutely
world but youth
dorian gray listened open eyed wondering spray lilac fell
hand gravel furry bee came buzzed round
moment began scramble oval stellated
globe tiny blossoms watched strange
trivial things try develop things high import
make afraid stirred new emotion
find expression thought terrifies lays
sudden siege brain calls yield time
bee flew away saw creeping stained trumpet tyrian
convolvulus flower quiver swayed gently
fro
suddenly painter appeared door studio
staccato signs come turned
smiled
i waiting cried come light quite perfect
bring drinks
rose sauntered walk green white
butterflies fluttered past pear tree corner
garden thrush began sing
glad met mr gray said lord henry looking
yes i glad i wonder shall i glad
dreadful word makes shudder i hear
women fond using spoil romance trying
make meaningless word
difference caprice lifelong passion caprice
lasts little longer
entered studio dorian gray hand lord henry s
arm case let friendship caprice murmured
flushing boldness stepped platform
resumed pose
lord henry flung large wicker arm chair watched
sweep dash brush canvas sound

charming exaggeration friendship listened laughed
forgotten influenced nature

terrible warning brevity stirred time
stood gazing shadow loveliness
reality description flashed yes
day face wrinkled wizen eyes dim
colourless grace figure broken deformed scarlet
pass away lips gold steal hair

life said pathos left unmoved but
beauty mere beauty eyes tears i tell

jew manager met door beaming ear ear
oily tremulous smile escorted box sort
pompous humility waving fat jewelled hands talking
voice dorian gray loathed felt
come look miranda met caliban lord
henry hand liked declared
insisted shaking hand assuring
proud meet man discovered real genius gone
bankrupt poet hallward amused watching faces
pit heat terribly oppressive huge sunlight
flamed like monstrous dahlia petals yellow youths
gallery taken coats waistcoats hung
talked theatre shared
oranges tawdry girls sat women
laughing pit voices horribly shrill
discordant sound popping corks came bar
place find s divinity said lord henry

motionless dream sat dorian gray gazing
lord henry peered glasses murmuring charming charming
scene hall capulet s house romeo pilgrim s
dress entered mercutio friends band

crowd ungainly shabbily dressed actors sibyl vane moved like
creature finer world body swayed danced
plant sways water curves throat curves
white lily hands cool ivory
curiously listless showed sign joy
eyes rested romeo words speak
good pilgrim wrong hand
mannerly devotion shows
saints hands pilgrims hands touch
palm palm holy palmers kiss
brief dialogue follows spoken thoroughly
artificial manner voice exquisite but point view
tone absolutely false wrong colour took away
life verse passion unreal
dorian gray grew pale watched puzzled anxious
friends dared say
absolutely incompetent horribly disappointed
felt true test juliet balcony scene
second act waited failed
looked charming came moonlight
denied but staginess acting unbearable grew
worse went gestures absurdly artificial
overemphasized say beautiful passage
thou knowest mask night face
maiden blush bepaint cheek
thou hast heard speak night
declaimed painful precision schoolgirl
taught recite second rate professor elocution
leaned balcony came wonderful lines
i joy thee
i joy contract night
rash unadvised sudden
like lightning doth cease
ere say lightens sweet good night
bud love summer s ripening breath
prove beauteous flower meet
spoke words conveyed meaning
nervousness far nervous absolutely
self contained simply bad art complete failure
common uneducated audience pit gallery lost
play got restless began talk loudly

tears sobs annoyed
i going said calm clear voice i don t wish
unkind but i t disappointed
wept silently answer but crept nearer little
hands stretched blindly appeared seeking
turned heel left room moments
theatre
went hardly knew remembered wandering dimly
lit streets past gaunt black shadowed archways evil looking
houses women hoarse voices harsh laughter called
drunkards reeled cursing chattering
like monstrous apes seen grotesque children huddled
door steps heard shrieks oaths gloomy courts
dawn breaking found close covent garden
darkness lifted flushed faint fires sky hollowed
perfect pearl huge carts filled nodding lilies
rumbled slowly polished street air heavy
perfume flowers beauty bring
anodyne pain followed market watched men
unloading waggons white smocked carter offered
cherries thanked wondered refused accept money
began eat listlessly plucked
midnight coldness moon entered long
line boys carrying crates striped tulips yellow red
roses defiled threading way huge
jade green piles vegetables portico grey
sun bleached pillars loitered troop draggled bareheaded girls
waiting auction crowded round swinging
doors coffee house piazza heavy cart horses slipped
stamped rough stones shaking bells trappings
drivers lying asleep pile sacks iris necked
pink footed pigeons ran picking seeds
little hailed hansom drove home
moments loitered doorstep looking round silent
square blank close shuttered windows staring blinds
sky pure opal roofs houses glistened like
silver chimney opposite wreath smoke
rising curled violet riband nacre coloured air
huge gilt venetian lantern spoil doge s barge
hung ceiling great oak panelled hall entrance
lights burning flickering jets blue petals
flame rimmed white turned
having thrown hat cape table passed library
door bedroom large octagonal chamber
ground floor new born feeling luxury
decorated hung curious renaissance tapestries
discovered stored disused attic selby royal
turning handle door eye fell portrait
basil hallward painted started surprise
went room looking somewhat puzzled
taken button hole coat hesitate
finally came went picture examined
dim arrested light struggled cream coloured silk
blinds face appeared little changed
expression looked different said
touch cruelty mouth certainly strange
turned round walking window drew blind
bright dawn flooded room swept fantastic shadows dusky
corners lay shuddering but strange expression
noticed face portrait linger
intensified quivering ardent sunlight showed
lines cruelty round mouth clearly looking
mirror dreadful thing
winced taking table oval glass framed ivory
cupids lord henry s presents glanced hurriedly
polished depths line like warped red lips
mean
rubbed eyes came close picture examined
signs change looked
actual painting doubt expression
altered mere fancy thing
horribly apparent
threw chair began think suddenly
flashed mind said basil hallward s studio
day picture finished yes remembered perfectly
uttered mad wish remain young
portrait grow old beauty untarnished
face canvas bear burden passions sins
painted image seared lines suffering
thought delicate bloom loveliness
conscious boyhood surely wish
fulfilled things impossible monstrous
think picture
touch cruelty mouth
cruelty cruel girl s fault
dreamed great artist given love
thought great disappointed
shallow unworthy feeling infinite regret came
thought lying feet sobbing like little
child remembered callousness watched
like soul given
but suffered terrible hours
play lasted lived centuries pain aeon aeon
torture life worth marred
moment wounded age women better
suited bear sorrow men lived emotions
thought emotions took lovers merely
scenes lord henry told
lord henry knew women trouble
sibyl vane
but picture say held secret
life told story taught love
beauty teach loathe soul look
merely illusion wrought troubled senses
horrible night passed left phantoms
suddenly fallen brain tiny scarlet speck
makes men mad picture changed folly think
watching beautiful marred face cruel
smile bright hair gleamed early sunlight blue eyes
met sense infinite pity but
painted image came altered
alter gold wither grey red white
roses die sin committed stain fleck
wreck fairness but sin picture changed
unchanged visible emblem conscience
resist temptation lord henry
rate listen subtle poisonous theories basil
hallward s garden stirred passion
impossible things sibyl vane make amends
marry try love yes duty
suffered poor child selfish
cruel fascination exercised
return happy life
beautiful pure
got chair drew large screen right
portrait shuddering glanced horrible murmured
walked window opened
stepped grass drew deep breath fresh morning
air drive away sombre passions thought
sibyl faint echo love came repeated
birds singing
dew drenched garden telling flowers
chapter
long past noon awoke valet crept times
tiptoe room stirring wondered
young master sleep late finally bell sounded
victor came softly cup tea pile letters
small tray old sevres china drew olive satin
curtains shimmering blue lining hung
tall windows

o clock victor asked dorian gray drowsily

opened listlessly contained usual collection
cards invitations dinner tickets private views programmes
charity concerts like showered fashionable
young men morning season heavy
chased silver louis quinze toilet set

old fashioned people realize live age
unnecessary things necessities
courteously worded communications jermyn street money lenders
offering advance sum money moment s notice
reasonable rates
minutes got throwing elaborate
dressing gown silk embroidered cashmere wool passed
onyx paved bathroom cool water refreshed long
sleep forgotten gone
dim sense having taken strange tragedy came
twice but unreality dream
soon dressed went library sat
light french breakfast laid small round
table close open window exquisite day warm air
laden spices bee flew buzzed round
blue dragon bowl filled sulphur yellow roses stood
felt perfectly happy
suddenly eye fell screen placed
portrait started
cold monsieur asked valet putting omelette
table i shut window
dorian shook head i cold murmured
true portrait really changed

man stood waiting orders dorian looked
moment i home victor said sigh
man bowed retired
rose table lit cigarette flung
luxuriously cushioned couch stood facing screen screen
old gilt spanish leather stamped wrought
florid louis quatorze pattern scanned curiously
wondering concealed secret man s life

use knowing thing true terrible
true trouble but fate
deadlier chance eyes spied saw horrible
change basil hallward came asked look

o clock struck half hour rang double
chime but dorian gray stir trying gather
scarlet threads life weave pattern find
way sanguine labyrinth passion
wandering know think finally
went table wrote passionate letter girl
loved imploring forgiveness accusing madness
covered page page wild words sorrow wilder words

hideous
charming artistic basis ethics dorian i congratulate
but going begin
marrying sibyl vane
marrying sibyl vane cried lord henry standing looking
perplexed amazement but dear dorian
yes harry i know going say dreadful
marriage don t say don t say things kind
days ago i asked sibyl marry i going
break word wife
wife dorian didn t letter i wrote
morning sent note man
letter oh yes i remember i read harry i
afraid i wouldn t like
cut life pieces epigrams
know
mean
lord henry walked room sitting dorian gray
took hands held tightly dorian
said letter don t frightened tell sibyl vane
dead
cry pain broke lad s lips leaped feet
tearing hands away lord henry s grasp dead sibyl dead
true horrible lie dare say
quite true dorian said lord henry gravely
morning papers i wrote ask
till i came inquest course
mixed things like make man fashionable
paris but london people prejudiced
make s debut scandal reserve
s old age i suppose don t know
theatre don t right going
round room important point
dorian answer moments dazed horror
finally stammered stifled voice harry say
inquest mean sibyl oh harry i t
bear but quick tell
i doubt accident dorian
way public leaving
theatre mother half past said
forgotten upstairs waited time but
come ultimately found lying dead
floor dressing room swallowed mistake
dreadful thing use theatres i don t know
but prussic acid white lead i fancy
prussic acid died instantaneously
harry harry terrible cried lad
yes tragic course but mixed
i standard seventeen i
thought younger looked child
know little acting dorian mustn t let
thing nerves come dine
look opera patti night
everybody come sister s box got
smart women
i murdered sibyl vane said dorian gray half
murdered surely i cut little throat knife
roses lovely birds sing
happily garden night i dine
opera sup i suppose
extraordinarily dramatic life i read book
harry i think i wept
happened actually far wonderful tears
passionate love letter i written
life strange passionate love letter
addressed dead girl feel i wonder white silent
people call dead sibyl feel know listen
oh harry i loved years ago
came dreadful night really
night played badly heart broke
explained terribly pathetic but i
moved bit i thought shallow suddenly happened
afraid i t tell but terrible i
said i i felt i wrong
dead god god harry shall i don t know
danger i straight
right kill
selfish
dear dorian answered lord henry taking cigarette case
producing gold latten matchbox way woman
reform man boring completely loses possible
life married girl
wretched course treated kindly
kind people cares but
soon found absolutely indifferent
woman finds husband
dreadfully dowdy wears smart bonnets woman s
husband pay i say social mistake
abject course i allowed but
i assure case thing
absolute failure
i suppose muttered lad walking room
looking horribly pale but i thought duty
fault terrible tragedy prevented
right i remember saying fatality good
resolutions late certainly
good resolutions useless attempts interfere scientific
laws origin pure vanity result absolutely nil
luxurious sterile emotions
certain charm weak said
simply cheques men draw bank
account
harry cried dorian gray coming sitting
i feel tragedy i want i
don t think i heartless
foolish things fortnight
entitled dorian answered lord henry
sweet melancholy smile
lad frowned i don t like explanation harry rejoined
but i glad don t think i heartless i
kind i know i i admit thing
happened affect simply
like wonderful ending wonderful play terrible
beauty greek tragedy tragedy i took great but
i wounded
interesting question said lord henry found
exquisite pleasure playing lad s unconscious egotism
extremely interesting question i fancy true explanation
happens real tragedies life occur
inartistic manner hurt crude violence
absolute incoherence absurd want meaning entire lack
style affect vulgarity affects
impression sheer brute force revolt
tragedy possesses artistic elements
beauty crosses lives elements beauty real
thing simply appeals sense dramatic effect suddenly
find longer actors but spectators
play watch mere wonder
spectacle enthralls present case
really happened killed love i
wish i experience
love love rest life people adored
but
insisted living long i ceased care
care stout tedious i
meet reminiscences awful memory
woman fearful thing utter intellectual
stagnation reveals absorb colour life but
remember details details vulgar
i sow poppies garden sighed dorian
necessity rejoined companion life
poppies hands course things linger i
wore but violets season form artistic
mourning romance die ultimately
die i forget killed i think proposing
sacrifice world dreadful moment
fills terror eternity believe
week ago lady hampshire s i found seated dinner
lady question insisted going
thing digging past raking future i
buried romance bed asphodel dragged
assured i spoiled life i bound state
ate enormous dinner i feel anxiety but lack
taste showed charm past past
but women know curtain fallen want
sixth act soon play entirely
propose continue allowed way
comedy tragic ending tragedy culminate
farce charmingly artificial but sense
art fortunate i i assure dorian
women i known sibyl vane
ordinary women console
going sentimental colours trust woman
wears mauve age woman thirty
fond pink ribbons means history
find great consolation suddenly discovering good
qualities husbands flaunt conjugal felicity
s face fascinating sins religion
consoles mysteries charm flirtation
woman told i quite understand
makes vain told sinner conscience makes
egotists yes really end consolations
women find modern life i mentioned
important
harry said lad listlessly
oh obvious consolation taking s admirer
loses s good society whitewashes woman but
really dorian different sibyl vane
women meets quite beautiful
death i glad i living century wonders happen
make believe reality things play
romance passion love
i terribly cruel forget
i afraid women appreciate cruelty downright cruelty
wonderfully primitive instincts
emancipated but remain slaves looking
masters love dominated i sure
splendid i seen really absolutely angry but i
fancy delightful looked said
day yesterday time merely
fanciful but i absolutely true holds key
harry
said sibyl vane represented heroines
romance desdemona night ophelia
died juliet came life imogen
come life muttered lad burying
face hands
come life played but
think lonely death tawdry dressing room simply
strange lurid fragment jacobean tragedy wonderful
scene webster ford cyril tourneur girl really
lived really died
dream phantom flitted shakespeare s plays
left lovelier presence reed shakespeare s
music sounded richer joy moment touched
actual life marred marred passed away
mourn ophelia like ashes head
cordelia strangled cry heaven daughter
brabantio died but don t waste tears sibyl vane
real
silence evening darkened room noiselessly
silver feet shadows crept garden
colours faded wearily things
time dorian gray looked explained
harry murmured sigh relief i
felt said but i afraid i
express know but
talk happened marvellous experience
i wonder life store
marvellous
life store dorian
extraordinary good looks able
but suppose harry i haggard old wrinkled
ah said lord henry rising dear dorian
fight victories brought
good looks live age reads
wise thinks beautiful
spare better dress drive
club late
i think i shall join opera harry i feel tired eat
number sister s box
seven i believe grand tier
door but i sorry won t come dine
i don t feel said dorian listlessly but i awfully
obliged said certainly
best friend understood
beginning friendship dorian answered lord
henry shaking hand good bye i shall
thirty i hope remember patti singing
closed door dorian gray touched bell
minutes victor appeared lamps drew blinds
waited impatiently man
interminable time
soon left rushed screen drew
change picture received news
sibyl vane s death known
conscious events life occurred vicious cruelty
marred fine lines mouth doubt appeared
moment girl drunk poison
indifferent results merely cognizance
passed soul wondered hoped day
change taking place eyes shuddering

cold rain began fall blurred street lamps looked ghastly
dripping mist public houses closing dim men
women clustering broken groups round doors
bars came sound horrible laughter
drunkards brawled screamed
lying hansom hat pulled forehead dorian
gray watched listless eyes sordid shame great city
repeated words lord henry said
day met cure soul means
senses senses means soul yes
secret tried try
opium dens buy oblivion dens horror
memory old sins destroyed madness sins

moon hung low sky like yellow skull time time
huge misshapen cloud stretched long arm hid
gas lamps grew fewer streets narrow gloomy
man lost way drive half mile steam rose
horse splashed puddles sidewindows hansom
clogged grey flannel mist
cure soul means senses senses means

strange bottle shaped kilns orange
fanlike tongues dog barked went far away
darkness wandering sea gull screamed horse stumbled
rut swerved aside broke gallop
time left clay road rattled
rough paven streets windows dark but
fantastic shadows silhouetted lamplit blind

said passion makes think circle certainly
hideous iteration bitten lips dorian gray shaped reshaped
subtle words dealt soul sense till found
expression mood justified
intellectual approval passions justification

ugliness hateful things real
dear reason ugliness

forgetfulness days free
suddenly man drew jerk dark lane
low roofs jagged chimney stacks houses rose black

yards
sir ain t asked huskily
trap
dorian started peered round answered
having got hastily given driver extra fare
promised walked quickly direction quay
lantern gleamed stern huge merchantman
light shook splintered puddles red glare came
outward bound steamer coaling slimy pavement looked like
wet mackintosh
hurried left glancing
followed seven minutes reached small
shabby house wedged gaunt factories
windows stood lamp stopped gave peculiar knock
little time heard steps passage chain
unhooked door opened quietly went saying
word squat misshapen figure flattened
shadow passed end hall hung tattered green
curtain swayed shook gusty wind followed
street dragged aside entered long low room
looked rate dancing saloon shrill
flaring gas jets dulled distorted fly blown mirrors
faced ranged round walls greasy reflectors ribbed
tin backed making quivering disks light floor
covered ochre coloured sawdust trampled mud
stained dark rings spilled liquor malays
crouching little charcoal stove playing bone counters
showing white teeth chattered corner
head buried arms sailor sprawled table
tawdrily painted bar ran complete stood
haggard women mocking old man brushing sleeves
coat expression disgust thinks s got red ants
laughed dorian passed man looked
terror began whimper
end room little staircase leading
darkened chamber dorian hurried rickety steps
heavy odour opium met heaved deep breath
nostrils quivered pleasure entered young man
smooth yellow hair bending lamp lighting long
pipe looked nodded hesitating manner
adrian muttered dorian
i answered listlessly chaps

i thought left england
darlington going brother paid
george doesn t speak i don t care added
sigh long stuff doesn t want friends
i think i friends
dorian winced looked round grotesque things lay
fantastic postures ragged mattresses twisted limbs
gaping mouths staring lustreless eyes fascinated knew
strange heavens suffering dull hells
teaching secret new joy better
prisoned thought memory like horrible malady
eating soul away time time eyes
basil hallward looking felt stay

dorian commit murder i sorry i hurt
vanity saying but i assure true crime belongs
exclusively lower orders i don t blame smallest
degree i fancy crime art
simply method procuring extraordinary sensations
method procuring sensations think man
committed murder possibly crime

henry laughing important secrets life

laugh like thrush singing pretty
cotton dresses large hats knew but
lost
reached home found servant waiting sent
bed threw sofa library
began think things lord henry said
really true change felt wild longing
unstained purity boyhood rose white boyhood
lord henry called knew tarnished
filled mind corruption given horror fancy
evil influence experienced terrible
joy lives crossed
fairest promise brought
shame but irretrievable hope
ah monstrous moment pride passion prayed
portrait bear burden days
unsullied splendour eternal youth failure
better sin life brought sure
swift penalty purification punishment
forgive sins but smite iniquities
prayer man god
curiously carved mirror lord henry given
years ago standing table white limbed cupids
laughed round old took
night horror noted change fatal
picture wild tear dimmed eyes looked polished
shield terribly loved written
mad letter ending idolatrous words world changed
ivory gold curves lips
rewrite history phrases came memory repeated
loathed beauty
flinging mirror floor crushed silver splinters
beneath heel beauty ruined beauty
youth prayed but things
life free stain beauty but
mask youth but mockery youth best green
unripe time time shallow moods sickly thoughts
worn livery youth spoiled
better think past alter
future think james
vane hidden nameless grave selby churchyard alan campbell
shot night laboratory but revealed
secret forced know excitement
basil hallward s disappearance soon pass away
waning perfectly safe
death basil hallward weighed mind
living death soul troubled basil painted
portrait marred life forgive
portrait basil said things
unbearable borne patience
murder simply madness moment alan campbell
suicide act chosen
new life wanted waiting
surely begun spared innocent
thing rate tempt innocence
good
thought hetty merton began wonder portrait
locked room changed surely horrible
life pure able expel
sign evil passion face signs evil
gone away look
took lamp table crept upstairs unbarred
door smile joy flitted strangely young looking face
lingered moment lips yes good
hideous thing hidden away longer terror
felt load lifted
went quietly locking door custom
dragged purple hanging portrait cry pain
indignation broke change save
eyes look cunning mouth curved wrinkle
hypocrite thing loathsome loathsome
possible scarlet dew spotted hand
brighter like blood newly spilled trembled
merely vanity good deed
desire new sensation lord henry hinted mocking
laugh passion act makes things
finer
red stain larger crept like
horrible disease wrinkled fingers blood
painted feet thing dripped blood hand
held knife confess mean
confess death laughed felt
idea monstrous confess
believe trace murdered man
belonging destroyed burned
stairs world simply say mad
shut persisted story
duty confess suffer public shame make public
atonement god called men tell sins
earth heaven cleanse
till told sin sin shrugged shoulders
death basil hallward little thinking
hetty merton unjust mirror mirror soul
looking vanity curiosity hypocrisy
renunciation
thought but tell
vanity spared
hypocrisy worn mask goodness curiosity s sake
tried denial self recognized
but murder dog life
burdened past really confess
bit evidence left picture
evidence destroy kept long
given pleasure watch changing growing old
late felt pleasure kept awake night
away filled terror lest eyes
look brought melancholy passions
mere memory marred moments joy like
conscience yes conscience destroy
looked round saw knife stabbed basil hallward
cleaned times till stain left
bright glistened killed painter
kill painter s work meant kill
past dead free kill
monstrous soul life hideous warnings
peace seized thing stabbed picture
cry heard crash cry horrible
agony frightened servants woke crept rooms
gentlemen passing square stopped looked
great house walked till met policeman
brought man rang bell times but
answer light windows house
dark time went away stood adjoining portico
watched
house constable asked elder gentlemen
mr dorian gray s sir answered policeman
looked walked away sneered
sir henry ashton s uncle
inside servants house half clad domestics
talking low whispers old mrs leaf crying
wringing hands francis pale death
quarter hour got coachman
footmen crept upstairs knocked but reply
called finally vainly trying
force door got roof dropped
balcony windows yielded easily bolts old
entered found hanging wall splendid portrait
master seen wonder
exquisite youth beauty lying floor dead man
evening dress knife heart withered wrinkled
loathsome visage till examined rings
recognized
