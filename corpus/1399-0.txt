chapter
pestsov liked thrashing argument end
satisfied sergey ivanovitch s words especially felt
injustice view
i mean said soup addressing alexey
alexandrovitch mere density population but conjunction
fundamental ideas means principles
alexey alexandrovitch said languidly
haste s thing opinion influence
people possible people higher
development
but s question pestsov broke bass
hurry speak
soul saying make higher development
consist english french germans highest
stage development nationalize
rhine provinces turned french but germans
lower stage shouted law work
i fancy greater influence true
civilization said alexey alexandrovitch slightly lifting
eyebrows
but lay outward signs true civilization
said pestsov
i imagine signs generally known said alexey
alexandrovitch
but fully known sergey ivanovitch subtle
smile accepted view real culture purely
classical but intense disputes
question denying opposite camp strong
points favor
classics sergey ivanovitch red wine said
stepan arkadyevitch
i expressing opinion form culture sergey
ivanovitch said holding glass smile condescension
child i say sides strong arguments support
went addressing alexey alexandrovitch sympathies
classical education but discussion i personally unable
arrive conclusion i distinct grounds classical
studies given preeminence scientific studies
natural sciences great educational value
pestsov astronomy botany zoology
general principles
i quite agree responded alexey alexandrovitch
admit process studying
forms language peculiarly favorable influence intellectual
development denied influence
classical authors highest degree moral unfortunately
study natural sciences associated false
noxious doctrines curse day
sergey ivanovitch said but pestsov interrupted
rich bass began warmly contesting justice view
sergey ivanovitch waited serenely speak obviously convincing
reply ready
but said sergey ivanovitch smiling subtly addressing karenin
allow weigh advantages disadvantages
classical scientific studies difficult task question
form education preferred
quickly conclusively decided favor
classical education expressed moral disons le
mot anti nihilist influence
undoubtedly
distinctive property anti nihilistic
influence classical studies considered
subject weighed arguments sides said sergey
ivanovitch subtle smile given elbow room
tendencies but know little pills classical
learning possess medicinal property anti nihilism boldly
prescribe patients but
medicinal property wound humorously
sergey ivanovitch s little pills laughed turovtsin

conversation
stepan arkadyevitch mistake inviting pestsov
pestsov intellectual conversation flagged instant directly
sergey ivanovitch concluded conversation jest pestsov
promptly started new
i t agree said government aim
government obviously guided abstract considerations remains
indifferent influence measures exercise education
women instance naturally regarded likely
harmful but government opens schools universities women
conversation passed new subject education
women
alexey alexandrovitch expressed idea education women
apt confounded emancipation women
considered dangerous
i consider contrary questions inseparably

subjection women complete dates ages
unwilling recognize gulf separates
said
said rights said sergey ivanovitch waiting till pestsov
finished meaning right sitting juries voting
presiding official meetings right entering civil service
sitting parliament
undoubtedly
but women rare exception occupy positions
wrong using expression rights
correct say duties man agree duty
juryman witness telegraph clerk feel performing duties

i ve meaning long shall discussion
ll reading spencer
i ve finished reading said levin but i don t need
s s interesting
i mean i m fully convinced solution problems
i shall find like
but katavasov s serene good humored expression suddenly struck
felt tenderness happy mood
unmistakably disturbing conversation remembered
resolution stopped short
but ll talk later added going bee house
s way little path said addressing
going narrow path little uncut meadow covered
thick clumps brilliant heart s ease stood
tall dark green tufts hellebore levin settled guests
dense cool shade young aspens bench stumps
purposely visitors bee house afraid
bees went hut bread cucumbers
fresh honey regale
trying make movements deliberate possible listening
bees buzzed frequently past walked
little path hut entry bee hummed angrily
caught beard but carefully extricated going
shady outer room took wall veil hung
peg putting thrusting hands pockets
went fenced bee garden stood midst
closely mown space regular rows fastened bast posts
hives knew old stocks history
fences younger swarms hived year
openings hives eyes giddy watch bees
drones whirling round round spot
working bees flew spoils search
direction wood flowering lime trees
hives
ears filled incessant hum various notes
busy hum working bee flying quickly blaring
lazy drone excited buzz bees guard protecting
property enemy preparing sting farther
fence old bee keeper shaving hoop tub
levin levin stood midst beehives
call
glad chance recover influence
ordinary actual life depressed happy mood
thought time lose temper ivan
coolness brother talk flippantly katavasov
momentary mood pass leave
trace thought but instant going mood
felt delight new important happened
real life time overcast spiritual peace found
but untouched
bees whirling round menacing distracting
attention prevented enjoying complete physical peace
forced restrain movements avoid petty
cares swarmed moment got trap
restricted spiritual freedom but lasted long
bodily strength unaffected spite
bees spiritual strength
aware
